**Introduction:**

Infinite geometric series are sequences whose terms progress multiplicatively, with potentially infinitely many terms added together. Whether these infinite sums converge to a finite value or diverge depends chiefly on the magnitude of the common ratio \( r \). This section examines convergence criteria, the behavior of series for various values of \( r \), and concrete applications showcasing the profound significance of infinite series in mathematics and applied sciences.

### 8.9.1 Infinite Series with \( |r| < 1 \)

</figure>

**Definition:**  
Consider the infinite geometric series

$$
S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \ldots,
$$

where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. This series **converges** if

$$
|r| < 1,
$$

meaning the terms tend toward zero sufficiently fast so that the infinite sum approaches a finite limit.

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
Graphically, when \( |r| < 1 \), the terms form points that get closer to zero on the vertical axis as \( n \to \infty \), producing an exponentially decaying sequence, resulting in a finite sum represented as a limiting area under the sequence's curve.

**Theorem: Sum to Infinity of Infinite Geometric Series**

$$
\boxed{
S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \quad \text{for} \quad |r| < 1.
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: Define the partial sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms,

$$
S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.
$$

Step 2: As \( n \to \infty \), and since \( |r| < 1 \), \( r^n \to 0 \). Taking limits,

$$
S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = a \frac{1 - 0}{1 - r} = \frac{a}{1 - r}.
$$

This confirms the finite sum of the infinite series.

### 8.9.2 Behavior of Series with \( r > 1 \) or \( r < -1 \)

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Divergence in infinite geometric series for |r| > 1" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.9.3:</b> Divergence behavior of infinite geometric series where the common ratio exceeds 1 in magnitude</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

- If \( |r| > 1 \), then the terms \( ar^{n} \) grow without bound in magnitude as \( n \to \infty \).
- If \( r < -1 \), terms oscillate in sign and increase in magnitude.
- **In both cases, the infinite geometric series diverges**; it does not sum to a finite limit.

**Behavior:**

- The terms of the series grow exponentially large (positive or negative alternation), so no finite sum exists.
- The partial sums \( S_n \) do not approach any limit as \( n \to \infty \).

### 8.9.3 Applications of Infinite Series

Infinite geometric series occur in many fields:

1. **Finance**: Calculation of the present value of perpetuities or infinite annuities where cash flows continue forever but diminish.

2. **Physics**: Modeling decay processes such as radioactive decay or damped oscillations.

3. **Computer Science**: Analysis of recursive algorithms and computational complexity involving infinite processes.

4. **Mathematics**: Representation of repeating decimals, power series expansions, and convergence tests.

### Formulas & Working Rule (Algorithm)

**Formulas:**

- Sum of infinite geometric series (with \( |r| < 1 \)):

$$
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}.
$$

- Convergence condition:

$$
|r| < 1 \implies \text{series converges;}
$$

$$
|r| \geq 1 \implies \text{series diverges.}
$$

---

**Working Rule for Problems on Infinite Geometric Series:**

1. **Step 1:** Identify the first term \( a \) and the common ratio \( r \).

2. **Step 2:** Verify if \( |r| < 1 \). If not, series diverges; no finite sum.

3. **Step 3:** If convergent, use the sum to infinity formula \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \) to find the sum.

4. **Step 4:** For word problems, model the scenario accordingly, extract \( a \) and \( r \), and apply the formula.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Find the sum to infinity of the series

$$
5 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{5}{4} + \frac{5}{8} + \ldots.
$$

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a = 5 \), \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), \( |r| < 1 \), so the series converges.

Step 2: Sum to infinity:

$$
S = \frac{5}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 10.
$$

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Does the infinite series \( 3 - 6 + 12 - 24 + \ldots \) converge? If so, find its sum.

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a = 3 \), \( r = -2 \), \( |r| = 2 > 1 \).

Step 2: Since \( |r| > 1 \), the series diverges.

Answer: No finite sum exists; series diverges.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

A ball rebounds to \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its height after each bounce. If dropped from 16 m, find the total distance covered by the ball until it comes to rest.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Initial fall = 16 m.

Step 2: Heights rebounded form a GP with \( a = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \), \( r = \frac{3}{4} \).

Step 3: Total distance (excluding initial drop) is twice the sum of the infinite series of rebounds:

$$
S = 2 \times \frac{12}{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = 2 \times \frac{12}{\frac{1}{4}} = 2 \times 48 = 96.
$$

Step 4: Total distance = initial drop + rebounds = \(16 + 96 = 112\) m.
