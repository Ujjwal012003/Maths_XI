</figure>

**Concept:**  
Mixed sequences involve elements from different progressions, such as an arithmetic progression combined with a geometric progression, or the interleaving of two different types. These sequences require flexible strategies for analyzing terms and sums.

---

**Problem 1 (Mixed Sequence):**  
Consider the sequence defined by

$$
a_n = 3n + 2 \cdot 2^{n-1}, \quad n \geq 1.
$$

Find the 5th term \( a_5 \).

**Solution:**  

Step 1: Plug \( n = 5 \) into the sequence:

$$
a_5 = 3 \times 5 + 2 \times 2^{5-1} = 15 + 2 \times 16 = 15 + 32 = 47.
$$

Answer: \( a_5 = 47 \).

---

**Problem 2 (Sum of Mixed Sequence):**  
Find the sum of the first 4 terms of the sequence:

$$
a_n = 2n + 3^n.
$$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Calculate terms explicitly:

- \( a_1 = 2(1) + 3^1 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
- \( a_2 = 4 + 9 = 13 \)
- \( a_3 = 6 + 27 = 33 \)
- \( a_4 = 8 + 81 = 89 \)

Step 2: Sum:

$$
S_4 = 5 + 13 + 33 + 89 = 140.
$$

Answer: \( S_4 = 140 \).

</figure>

**Concept:**  
Sequences may be generalized to include polynomial or combined terms. Understanding these leads to higher-order sequences and series involving sums of powers or exponential-linear mixtures.

---

**Problem 3 (Nth Term Generalization):**  
Find the \( n^{th} \) term of the sequence where

$$
a_n = n^2 + 2^n.
$$

Evaluate \( a_3 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Substitute \( n = 3 \):

$$
a_3 = 3^2 + 2^3 = 9 + 8 = 17.
$$

Answer: \( a_3 = 17 \).

---

**Problem 4 (Sum Involving Sums of Powers):**  
Evaluate

$$
S = \sum_{n=1}^{5} n^2.
$$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Use formula for sum of squares:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N n^2 = \frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6}.
$$

Step 2: Substitute \( N=5 \):

$$
S = \frac{5 \times 6 \times 11}{6} = 55.
$$

Answer: \( S = 55 \).

### 8.11.3 Higher Order Proofs Related to Sequences

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Proof of inequalities and relations in sequences" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.11.4:</b> Schematic representation of proving properties and inequalities of sequences</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Concept:**  
Proving relationships and inequalities requires formal steps, sometimes invoking induction or theorems like AM-GM inequality.

---

**Theorem (AM-GM Inequality for Two Non-Negative Numbers):**  
For any \( x, y \geq 0 \),

$$
\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}
$$

with equality iff \( x = y \).

---

**Proof:**

Step 1: Consider \( ( \sqrt{x} - \sqrt{y} )^2 \geq 0 \), expanding:

$$
x - 2\sqrt{xy} + y \geq 0 \implies x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}.
$$

Step 2: Divide both sides by 2:

$$
\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}.
$$

Equality holds iff \( \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{y} \), i.e., \( x = y \).

---

**Problem 5 (Inequality Proof based on AM-GM):**

Show that for positive numbers \( a, b \), and \( c \) in arithmetic progression, the following holds:

$$
a^2 + c^2 \geq 2b^2.
$$

**Solution:**

Step 1: Since \( a, b, c \) are in AP,

$$
2b = a + c.
$$

Step 2: Using AM-GM inequality on \( a^2 \) and \( c^2 \):

$$
\frac{a^2 + c^2}{2} \geq \sqrt{a^2 c^2} = ac.
$$

Step 3: From the AP,

$$
a + c = 2b \Rightarrow (a + c)^2 = 4b^2.
$$

Step 4: Expand:

$$
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = 4b^2,
$$

Rearranged:

$$
a^2 + c^2 = 4b^2 - 2ac.
$$

Step 5: Using the inequality from Step 2,

$$
a^2 + c^2 \geq 2ac,
$$

and from above,

$$
a^2 + c^2 = 4b^2 - 2ac,
$$

Combining inequalities implies:

$$
4b^2 - 2ac \geq 2ac \implies 4b^2 \geq 4ac \implies b^2 \geq ac.
$$

Also, since \( a, b, c \) are in AP, it's known \( b^2 \leq ac \). Combining yields:

$$
a^2 + c^2 \geq 2b^2,
$$

completing the proof.

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Advanced Problems and Proofs

1. Identify the sequence type and nature of the problem (mixed, generalized, proof).

2. For mixed/generalized sequences, evaluate terms by direct substitution or expansion.

3. For sum problems, decompose into known summations or apply formulas accordingly.

4. For proofs, start by stating known properties (e.g., AM-GM inequality, induction).

5. Break the proof into small logical steps, clearly justifying transitions.

6. Verify any equality/inequality conditions explicitly.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Given \( a_n = 2n + 3^n \), find \( a_4 \).

**Solution:**  
Step 1: \( a_4 = 8 + 81 = 89 \).  
Answer: \( 89 \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
If \( a, b, c \) are in AP, prove that \( a^2 + c^2 \geq 2b^2 \).

**Solution:** Refer to detailed proof above.  

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Prove that for positive real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \),

$$
\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n},
$$

with equality iff all \( x_i \) are equal.

**Solution:**  

Step 1: Use Mathematical Induction on \( n \).  
Step 2: Base case \( n=2 \) is the AM-GM inequality already proved.  
Step 3: Assume true for \( n = k \).  
Step 4: Prove for \( n = k+1 \) by splitting and applying inductive hypothesis and base case arguments.  
Step 5: Deduce equality condition.
