**Introduction:**

This section consolidates all the essential formulas related to sequences and series covered so far, specifically focusing on Arithmetic Progression (AP), Geometric Progression (GP), and Infinite Geometric Series. Understanding these formulas with their proofs and geometric interpretations is crucial for solving a wide range of problems efficiently. The summary also presents a working framework on how to apply these formulas methodically in different contexts.

### 8.6.1 Summary of Arithmetic Progression Formulas

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.6.2:</b> Linear growth of terms in arithmetic progression</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence such that the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant, called the **common difference** \( d \).

**Formulas:**

- General term (n-th term) of AP:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

- Sum of first \( n \) terms:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)
$$

- Alternative formula for sum:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
When plotted, terms lie on a straight line, showing a constant linear increase or decrease.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.6.3:</b> Exponential pattern of terms in geometric progression</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the **common ratio** \( r \).

**Formulas:**

- General term (n-th term) of GP:

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
$$

- Sum of first \( n \) terms (for \( r \neq 1 \)):

$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
$$

- Product of first \( n \) terms:

$$
P_n = a^n \cdot r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
Terms lie on an exponential curve, showing multiplicative growth or decay depending on \( r \).

</figure>

**Definition:**  
An infinite geometric series is the sum of infinitely many terms of a GP with common ratio \( r \).

**Convergence criteria:**  
The series converges if and only if

$$
|r| < 1.
$$

**Formula for sum to infinity:**

$$
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
$$

provided \( |r| < 1 \).

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
The total area under an infinite sequence of diminishing rectangles representing terms approaches a finite limit.

### Theorems and Proofs Recap

**Arithmetic Progression \( n^{th} \) term:**  
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Adding \( d \) repeatedly leads to the formula.

---

**Arithmetic Progression sum of \( n \) terms:**
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d)
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Sum written forwards and backwards, adding term-wise to get the formula.

---

**Geometric Progression \( n^{th} \) term:**  
\[
a_n = a r^{n-1}
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Each term multiplies previous by \( r \).

---

**Geometric Progression sum of \( n \) terms:**

\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Multiply sum by \( r \), subtract, factor, and solve.

---

**Product of \( n \) terms of GP:**

\[
P_n = a^n r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Express product, sum exponents, apply arithmetic sum formula.

---

**Sum to infinity of GP:**

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}, \quad |r| < 1
\]

**Proof Sketch:** Take limit of sum of first \( n \) terms as \( n \to \infty \), use convergence of \( r^n \to 0 \).

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Solving Related Problems

1. Identify the sequence type: AP or GP.

2. Determine known parameters: first term \( a_1 \) or \( a \), common difference \( d \), common ratio \( r \), number of terms \( n \).

3. Choose the correct formula depending on what is asked (term, sum, or product).

4. For infinite series, check convergence \( |r| < 1 \) before applying sum to infinity formula.

5. Substitute values carefully and calculate.

6. Verify special conditions (e.g., \( r \neq 1 \), \( n \) positive integer).

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Given the AP \( 4, 7, 10, \ldots \), find the 10th term.

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a_1 = 4 \), \( d = 3 \).

Step 2: Use formula:

\[
a_{10} = 4 + (10 - 1) \times 3 = 4 + 27 = 31.
\]

Answer: \( a_{10} = 31 \).

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Sum of first 6 terms of GP \( 2, 6, 18, \ldots \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a = 2 \), \( r = 3 \), \( n = 6 \).

Step 2: Use formula:

\[
S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3} = 2 \frac{1 - 729}{1 - 3} = 2 \times \frac{-728}{-2} = 728.
\]

Answer: \( S_6 = 728 \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Find sum to infinity of GP \( 5, \frac{5}{3}, \frac{5}{9}, \ldots \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a = 5 \), \( r = \frac{1}{3} \), check \( |r| < 1 \).

Step 2: Use formula:

\[
S = \frac{5}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{5}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5.
\]

Answer: Sum to infinity is \( 7.5 \).
