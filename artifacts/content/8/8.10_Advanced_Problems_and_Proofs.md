**Introduction:**

Advanced problems and proofs deepen the understanding of sequences by linking them with fundamental inequalities such as the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM), exploring the relations between various terms in sequences, and rigorously proving key theorems. This section integrates algebraic insight with geometric intuition to empower students in tackling challenging mathematical problems.

### 8.10.1 AM-GM Inequality

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.10.2:</b> Geometric representation of the AM-GM inequality showing areas related to means</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
For any two non-negative real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), the Arithmetic Mean (AM) is always greater than or equal to the Geometric Mean (GM):

$$
\boxed{
\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}.
}
$$

Equality holds if and only if \( x = y \).

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
Consider two line segments of lengths \( x \) and \( y \). The AM corresponds to half the length of the segment formed by placing these two segments end to end, whereas the GM corresponds to the side length of a square having the same area as a rectangle with sides \( x \) and \( y \). The inequality thus compares lengths and areas visually.

**Theorem 1: AM-GM Inequality (Two Variables)**

$$
\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}, \quad x,y \geq 0.
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: Consider the non-negative quantity obtained by squaring the difference:

$$
(x - y)^2 \geq 0.
$$

Step 2: Expand the expression:

$$
x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \geq 0.
$$

Step 3: Rearranging terms:

$$
x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy.
$$

Step 4: Add \( 2xy \) to both sides and rewrite:

$$
x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \geq 4xy.
$$

Step 5: Note that the left-hand side is a perfect square:

$$
(x + y)^2 \geq 4xy,
$$

which implies

$$
x + y \geq 2\sqrt{xy}.
$$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$$
\frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy}.
$$

Equality holds if and only if \( x = y \).

**Extension to n Variables:**

For non-negative real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \),

$$
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}.
$$

### 8.10.2 Relations Between Terms

**Problem:** In an arithmetic progression,

- Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) terms equals \(\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)\).
- Show that \( a_m = \frac{a_p + a_q}{2} \) if \( m = \frac{p + q}{2} \).

**Proof 1:** (Sum formula)

Step 1: Write the sum of \( n \) terms:

$$
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n.
$$

Step 2: Reverse the sum:

$$
S_n = a_n + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1.
$$

Step 3: Add these two expressions term-wise:

$$
2S_n = (a_1 + a_n) + (a_2 + a_{n-1}) + \cdots + (a_n + a_1).
$$

Step 4: Each bracket sums to \( a_1 + a_n \), and there are \( n \) such pairs:

$$
2S_n = n (a_1 + a_n).
$$

Step 5: Hence:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n).
$$

---

**Proof 2:** \( a_m = \frac{a_p + a_q}{2} \) for \( m = \frac{p + q}{2} \):

Step 1: We know \( a_k = a_1 + (k - 1)d \).

Step 2: Write \( a_p \) and \( a_q \):

$$
a_p = a_1 + (p - 1)d, \quad a_q = a_1 + (q - 1)d.
$$

Step 3: Their average:

$$
\frac{a_p + a_q}{2} = \frac{2a_1 + (p + q - 2)d}{2} = a_1 + \left( \frac{p + q}{2} - 1 \right) d.
$$

Step 4: Since \( m = \frac{p + q}{2} \), we find:

$$
a_m = a_1 + (m - 1)d = \frac{a_p + a_q}{2}.
$$

Hence proved.

### 8.10.3 Proof of Theorems Related to Sequences

**Theorem:** In a GP, the square of the nth term is the product of the \( (n - r) \)th and \( (n + r) \)th terms.

Formally:

$$
a_n^2 = a_{n-r} \cdot a_{n+r}
$$

for all \( r \), \( n \) where terms are defined.

**Proof:**

Step 1: Recall the nth term of GP:

$$
a_k = a \cdot r^{k - 1}.
$$

Step 2: Express terms:

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}, \quad a_{n-r} = a \cdot r^{n - r - 1}, \quad a_{n+r} = a \cdot r^{n + r -1}.
$$

Step 3: Compute product \( a_{n-r} \cdot a_{n+r} \):

$$
a_{n-r} \cdot a_{n+r} = a^2 \cdot r^{(n - r -1) + (n + r -1)} = a^2 r^{2n - 2}.
$$

Step 4: Compute square of \( a_n \):

$$
a_n^2 = (a r^{n-1})^2 = a^2 r^{2n - 2}.
$$

Step 5: Equality holds:

$$
a_n^2 = a_{n-r} \cdot a_{n+r}.
$$

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building – AM-GM):**

Prove that for positive \( a \) and \( b \):

$$
\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}.
$$

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( (a - b)^2 \geq 0 \).

Step 2:

$$
a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \geq 0.
$$

Step 3:

$$
a^2 + b^2 \geq 2ab.
$$

Step 4:

$$
(a + b)^2 \geq 4ab.
$$

Step 5: Taking square roots,

$$
a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab}.
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}.
$$

Equality holds if \( a = b \).

**Example 2 (Competency Based – Relation in AP):**

If \( a_4 = 11 \) and \( a_{10} = 23 \) in an AP with common difference \( d \), find \( a_7 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Write:

$$
a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 11,
$$

$$
a_{10} = a_1 + 9d = 23.
$$

Step 2: Subtract to get \( d \):

$$
6d = 12 \Rightarrow d = 2.
$$

Step 3: Find \( a_1 \):

$$
a_1 + 3 \times 2 = 11 \Rightarrow a_1 = 5.
$$

Step 4: Compute \( a_7 \):

$$
a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 5 + 12 = 17.
$$

---

**Example 3 (HOTS – Relation in GP):**

In a GP, if \( a_3 = 16 \) and \( a_7 = 256 \), find \( a_5 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Express terms:

$$
a_3 = a r^2 = 16,
$$

$$
a_7 = a r^6 = 256.
$$

Step 2: Divide equations:

$$
\frac{a r^6}{a r^2} = r^4 = \frac{256}{16} = 16,
$$

so

$$
r = \sqrt[4]{16} = 2.
$$

Step 3: Substitute back to find \( a \):

$$
a \cdot 2^2 = 16 \Rightarrow a = 4.
$$

Step 4: Find \( a_5 \):

$$
a_5 = a r^{4} = 4 \times 2^{4} = 4 \times 16 = 64.
$$
