**Introduction:**

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed factor called the common ratio. This multiplicative structure leads to exponential growth or decay, making it vital in modeling natural phenomena such as population growth, radioactive decay, and financial compounding.

### 8.4.1 Definition of Geometric Progression

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.4.2:</b> Terms of a GP grow exponentially with common ratio \( r \)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
A **Geometric Progression (GP)** is a sequence \( \{a_n\} \) of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a constant called the **common ratio** \( r \). If the first term is \( a \), the sequence is:

$$
a, \quad ar, \quad ar^2, \quad ar^3, \quad \ldots, \quad ar^{n-1}.
$$

Here, \( n \) is a natural number representing the term's position.

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
The terms of a geometric progression, when represented graphically with term index \( n \) on the x-axis and term value \( a_n \) on the y-axis, form points on an exponential curve. For \( |r| > 1 \), the terms increase exponentially; for \( 0 < |r| < 1 \), they decrease approaching zero. Negative values of \( r \) cause the terms to oscillate in sign, producing alternating points above and below the x-axis.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.4.3:</b> Calculation of nth term in GP using first term and common ratio</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Theorem:**

The \( n^{th} \) term of a geometric progression with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) is:

$$
\boxed{
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}.
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: The first term is \( a_1 = a \).

Step 2: The second term is obtained by multiplying the first term by \( r \):

$$
a_2 = a \cdot r.
$$

Step 3: The third term is:

$$
a_3 = a_2 \cdot r = a \cdot r \cdot r = a \cdot r^2.
$$

Step 4: Similarly, the \( n^{th} \) term involves multiplying the first term by \( r \) exactly \( n-1 \) times:

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}.
$$

This confirms the formula for the \( n^{th} \) term.

### 8.4.3 Sum of First \( n \) Terms

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.4.4:</b> Summation of first n terms of GP explained and formula derived</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Theorem:**

The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric progression with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \neq 1 \) is:

$$
\boxed{
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r}.
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: Write the sum \( S_n \) explicitly:

$$
S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}.
$$

Step 2: Multiply both sides by \( r \):

$$
r S_n = ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} + ar^n.
$$

Step 3: Subtract these two equations term-wise:

$$
S_n - r S_n = a - ar^{n}.
$$

Step 4: Factor the left-hand side and right-hand side:

$$
S_n (1 - r) = a (1 - r^{n}).
$$

Step 5: Provided \( r \neq 1 \), solve for \( S_n \):

$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r}.
$$

### 8.4.4 Product of \( n \) Terms

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.4.5:</b> Product of first n terms of a GP explained</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Theorem:**

The product \( P_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric progression is:

$$
\boxed{
P_n = a^n \cdot r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}.
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: Express the product as:

$$
P_n = a \times ar \times ar^2 \times \cdots \times ar^{n-1}.
$$

Step 2: Factor out powers:

$$
P_n = a^{n} \times r^{0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1)}.
$$

Step 3: Sum the exponents of \( r \), which is the sum of an arithmetic series:

$$
0 + 1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
$$

Step 4: Substitute the sum into the expression:

$$
P_n = a^{n} \cdot r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}.
$$

### Formulas & Working Rule

**Formulas:**

$$
a_n = a r^{n-1}
$$

$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1
$$

$$
P_n = a^{n} \cdot r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
$$

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Solve GP Problems:**

1. Identify the first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \).

2. Use the \( n^{th} \) term formula \( a_n = a r^{n-1} \) to find any required term.

3. For summing the first \( n \) terms, apply

$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^{n}}{1 - r}.
$$

4. To calculate the product of first \( n \) terms, use

$$
P_n = a^{n} \cdot r^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}.
$$

5. Always verify the value of \( r \) (ensure \( r \neq 1 \) in sum formula) and check the domain of the problem.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Find the 6th term of the geometric progression: \( 2, 6, 18, \ldots \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify \( a = 2 \), \( r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).

Step 2: Use formula:

$$
a_6 = 2 \times 3^{6-1} = 2 \times 3^5 = 2 \times 243 = 486.
$$

**Answer:** \( 486 \)

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Find the sum of the first 5 terms of the geometric progression: \( 5, 15, 45, \ldots \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: \( a = 5 \), \( r = 3 \), \( n = 5 \).

Step 2: Sum formula:

$$
S_5 = 5 \frac{1 - 3^5}{1 - 3} = 5 \times \frac{1 - 243}{1 - 3} = 5 \times \frac{-242}{-2} = 5 \times 121 = 605.
$$

**Answer:** \( 605 \)

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

If the product of the first 4 terms of a geometric progression is 256 and the second term is 4, find the first term and the common ratio.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Let first term be \( a \) and common ratio \( r \).

Step 2: Product of first 4 terms:

$$
P_4 = a^4 \cdot r^{\frac{4 \times 3}{2}} = a^4 \cdot r^6 = 256.
$$

Step 3: The second term is:

$$
a r = 4.
$$

Step 4: Solve for \( a = \frac{4}{r} \) and substitute into product formula:

$$
\left(\frac{4}{r}\right)^4 \times r^6 = \frac{4^4}{r^4} \times r^6 = 4^4 \times r^{2} = 256 \times r^2 = 256.
$$

Step 5: Simplify:

$$
256 r^2 = 256 \implies r^2 = 1 \implies r = \pm 1.
$$

Step 6: If \( r = 1 \), then from step 3:

$$
a = \frac{4}{1} = 4.
$$

Since \( r = -1 \) can also be a solution:

$$
a = \frac{4}{-1} = -4.
$$

**Answer:** First term \( a = 4 \) or \( -4 \), common ratio \( r = 1 \) or \( -1 \).
