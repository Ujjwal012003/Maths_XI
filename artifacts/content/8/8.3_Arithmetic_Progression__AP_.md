**Introduction:**

An arithmetic progression (AP) is one of the most important and frequently used types of sequences in mathematics. It represents a linear pattern where each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed number called the common difference. This concept is widely applied in various fields such as finance for calculating interests, in physics for velocity increments, and in computer science for algorithm analysis.

### 8.3.1 Definition of Arithmetic Progression

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.3.2:</b> Terms of an AP spaced equally on a number line</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
An **arithmetic progression (AP)** is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant, called the **common difference** and denoted by \( d \).

If \( a_1 \) is the first term of the AP, then the sequence is:

$$
a_1, \quad a_1 + d, \quad a_1 + 2d, \quad a_1 + 3d, \quad \ldots
$$

The **common difference** \( d \) is defined as:

$$
d = a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = \ldots
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
On the real number line or coordinate plane, if we plot the term number \( n \) on the x-axis and the term value \( a_n \) on the y-axis, the points lie on a straight line with slope \( d \). This shows that terms of an AP increase (or decrease if \( d < 0 \)) linearly.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.3.3:</b> Linear relationship between term index and term value showing the nth term formula</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Theorem:**  
The \( n^{th} \) term \( a_n \) of an arithmetic progression with first term \( a_1 \) and common difference \( d \) is given by:

$$
\boxed{
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: The first term is \( a_1 \).

Step 2: The second term is \( a_2 = a_1 + d \).

Step 3: The third term is 

$$
a_3 = a_2 + d = a_1 + 2d.
$$

Step 4: Following this pattern, the \( n^{th} \) term is obtained by adding \( d \) repeatedly \( n-1 \) times:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.
$$

This formula allows direct computation of any term in the sequence without finding the preceding terms.

### 8.3.3 Sum of First \( n \) Terms

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.3.4:</b> Visual interpretation of sum of first \( n \) terms of an AP</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Theorem:**  
The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic progression is:

$$
\boxed{
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].
}
$$

**Proof:**

Step 1: Consider the sum of the first \( n \) terms:

$$
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n.
$$

Step 2: Write \( S_n \) in reverse order:

$$
S_n = a_n + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + \cdots + a_1.
$$

Step 3: Add the two sums term-wise:

$$
2 S_n = (a_1 + a_n) + (a_2 + a_{n-1}) + \cdots + (a_n + a_1).
$$

Each pair sums to \( a_1 + a_n \), and there are \( n \) such pairs, so

$$
2 S_n = n (a_1 + a_n).
$$

Step 4: Divide both sides by 2:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n).
$$

Step 5: Substitute \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \) into the expression to get:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].
$$

### 8.3.4 Common Difference

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.3.5:</b> Illustrating the common difference between consecutive terms of an AP</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
The **common difference** \( d \) is the constant amount added to each term to get the next term in the sequence:

$$
d = a_{k+1} - a_k, \quad k=1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

**Examples:**

- For the sequence \( 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots \),  

$$
d = 4 - 2 = 2.
$$

- For the sequence \( 10, 7, 4, 1, \ldots \),

$$
d = 7 - 10 = -3.
$$

### 8.3.5 Working Rule (Algorithm) for AP Problems

1. Identify the first term \( a_1 \) and the common difference \( d \).

2. Use the \( n^{th} \) term formula:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

to find any term.

3. To find the sum of the first \( n \) terms, use:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \quad \text{or} \quad S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].
$$

4. For unknowns in \( a_1 \), \( d \), or \( n \), set up equations using given terms or sums.

5. Always check if the problem involves finite or infinite terms (AP is finite by definition).

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Find the 8th term of the AP: \( 5, 8, 11, \ldots \).

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Identify \( a_1 = 5 \), \( d = 8 - 5 = 3 \).  
Step 2: Use \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \).  
Step 3: Compute 

$$
a_8 = 5 + (8-1) \times 3 = 5 + 21 = 26.
$$

**Answer:** \( a_8 = 26 \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Find the sum of the first 12 terms of the AP: \( 3, 7, 11, \ldots \).

**Solution:**  
Step 1: \( a_1 = 3 \), \( d = 7 - 3 = 4 \).  
Step 2: Find 

$$
a_{12} = 3 + (12-1) \times 4 = 3 + 44 = 47.
$$

Step 3: Calculate sum:

$$
S_{12} = \frac{12}{2} \times (3 + 47) = 6 \times 50 = 300.
$$

**Answer:** \( S_{12} = 300 \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an AP is \( S_n = 3n^2 + 5n \). Find the first term and common difference.

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Recall the sum formula:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].
$$

Step 2: Find the first term \( a_1 = S_1 \):

$$
a_1 = S_1 = 3(1)^2 + 5(1) = 3 + 5 = 8.
$$

Step 3: The \( n^{th} \) term is \( a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} \). Calculate the second term:

$$
a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = [3(2)^2 + 5(2)] - 8 = (12 + 10) - 8 = 22 - 8 = 14.
$$

Step 4: Calculate the common difference:

$$
d = a_2 - a_1 = 14 - 8 = 6.
$$

**Answer:** First term \( a_1 = 8 \), common difference \( d = 6 \).
