**Introduction:**

Sequences and series form an essential part of mathematical problem-solving, with applications spanning from pure mathematics to real-world scenarios such as finance and population growth. This section presents the key problem types involving arithmetic and geometric progressions, focusing on finding terms, sums, common differences or ratios, and applying these in word problems and proofs.

### 8.8.1 Finding nth Term in AP and GP

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.8.2:</b> Calculation of nth term in AP and GP sequences</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Formulas:**

- Arithmetic Progression (AP):

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

- Geometric Progression (GP):

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
$$

**Example:**

Find the 10th term of AP: \(5, 8, 11, \ldots\).

**Solution:**

Step 1: \(a_1 = 5\), \(d = 3\).

Step 2: Use formula:  

$$
a_{10} = 5 + (10-1) \times 3 = 5 + 27 = 32.
$$

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.8.3:</b> Formulas for sums of arithmetic and geometric series</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Formulas:**

- Sum of first \( n \) terms of AP:

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]
$$

- Sum of first \( n \) terms of GP:

$$
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1
$$

**Example:**

Sum of first 6 terms of GP: \(3, 6, 12, \ldots\)

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify \(a = 3, r = 2, n = 6\).

Step 2: Apply sum formula:

$$
S_6 = 3 \times \frac{1 - 2^6}{1 - 2} = 3 \times \frac{1 - 64}{-1} = 3 \times 63 = 189.
$$

---

### 8.8.3 Finding Common Difference and Ratio

**AP:**

$$
d = a_2 - a_1
$$

**GP:**

$$
r = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
$$

**Example:**

Sequence: \(4, 10, 16, \ldots\)

Find common difference \(d\):

$$
d = 10 - 4 = 6.
$$

### 8.8.4 Word Problems Involving Installments and Growth

Many real-life problems model scenarios like loan repayments or population growth using AP or GP.

**Example (Installments):**

A person repays a loan in 10 installments. The first installment is \$1000, increasing by \$100 every month. Find total amount paid.

**Solution:**

Identify AP with:  
\( a_1 = 1000, d = 100, n = 10 \).

Sum of installments:

$$
S_n = \frac{10}{2} [2 \times 1000 + (10 - 1) \times 100] = 5 (2000 + 900) = 5 \times 2900 = 14500.
$$

---

### 8.8.5 Proof-Based Problems

**Example:**  
Prove that the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( n^2 \).

**Proof:**

Step 1: Observe the sequence of odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5, \ldots, (2n -1)\).

Step 2: Sum of first \( n \) odd numbers:

$$
S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n -1).
$$

Step 3: This is an AP with \( a_1 = 1, d = 2 \), so

$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2 \times 1 + (n -1) \times 2] = \frac{n}{2} (2 + 2n -2) = \frac{n}{2} (2n) = n^2.
$$

Hence proved.

### Working Rule (Algorithm) To Solve Problems

1. Determine if the problem involves AP or GP.

2. Find known quantities (first term, common difference/ratio, term number).

3. Identify what is asked (term, sum, difference, ratio).

4. Apply appropriate formulas, substituting known values.

5. For word problems, translate context into sequence terms.

6. For proof problems, use formula manipulation and logical deductions.
