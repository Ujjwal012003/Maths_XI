**Introduction:**

Sequences and series form the foundation for understanding progressions of numbers and their summations. They appear naturally in various mathematical problems and real-life applications such as finance, computer science, and physics. This section introduces the basic concepts and sets a framework for the subsequent detailed study.

### 8.1.1 Definition of Sequences

</figure>

**Definition:**  
A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers written in a definite order. More formally, a sequence is a function

$$
a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R},
$$

where to each natural number \( n \), it assigns a real number \( a_n \). The value \( a_n \) is called the **\( n^{th} \) term** of the sequence. The sequence can be denoted by

$$
\{a_n\} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}.
$$

Each \( n \) belongs to the domain of natural numbers indicating the position of the term.

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
On the Cartesian plane, the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) can be represented as the set of points \( (n, a_n) \) where the \( x \)-coordinate is the natural number index and the \( y \)-coordinate is the value of the \( n^{th} \) term. Since \( n \) takes only integer values, the graph consists of isolated points aligned at integer \( x \)-coordinates.

For example, for a geometric sequence with first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \),

$$
a_n = a r^{n-1}, \quad n=1, 2, 3, \ldots,
$$

the points plotted reveal exponential growth or decay depending on \( r \).

### 8.1.2 Definition of Series

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.1.3:</b> Sum of sequence terms visualized as areas or cumulative sums</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
A **series** is the sum of the terms of a sequence. Given a sequence \( \{a_n\} \), the **series** formed by it is

$$
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k,
$$

where \( S_n \) is called the **partial sum** of the series. If the limit of \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) exists,

$$
S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n,
$$

then the series **converges** and the limit \( S \) is called the sum of the infinite series.

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
If we visualize the terms \( a_n \) as discrete quantities (for example, rectangles of height \( a_n \) and width 1 along the \( n \)-axis), the series \( S_n \) represents the cumulative area formed by these rectangles from \( n=1 \) up to \( n \). Graphically, this shows how the sum grows as more terms are added.

### 8.1.3 Importance and Applications of Sequences and Series

**Importance:**

1. **Mathematics and Calculus:** Sequences help understand limits, which are fundamental for defining derivatives and integrals.
2. **Finance:** Calculation of interests, annuities, and financial growth frequently rely on series and their sums.
3. **Computer Science:** Algorithms often use sequences and series to compute sums and analyze complexity.
4. **Physics:** Many phenomena such as oscillations, wave motion, and quantum mechanics utilize series expansions for solutions.
5. **Engineering:** Signal processing and control theory involve infinite series to model system behaviors.

**Theorem 1:**  
**Existence of Partial Sums of a Sequence**

*For any sequence \( \{a_n\} \), the sequence of its partial sums \( \{S_n\} \), where*

$$
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k,
$$

*always exists.*

**Proof:**

1. The sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is given, so each term \( a_n \) exists as a real number.
2. Define \( S_1 = a_1 \); trivially, \( S_1 \) exists as the sum of one term.
3. Assume \( S_{n-1} \) exists for some \( n \geq 2 \).
4. Then 

   $$
   S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n,
   $$

   which is the sum of two existing real numbers, and hence \( S_n \) exists in \( \mathbb{R} \).
5. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, \( S_n \) exists for all natural numbers \( n \).

This guarantees that the partial sums \( S_n \) can always be formed for any finite \( n \).

**Formulas & Working Rule for Sequences and Series**

**Formulas:**

1. \( n^{th} \) term of a sequence:  
   \[
   a_n
   \]

2. Sum of first \( n \) terms of a series:  
   \[
   S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k
   \]

3. For arithmetic sequence:  
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
   \]
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a_1 + (n-1)d \right)
   \]

4. For geometric sequence:  
   \[
   a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}
   \]
   \[
   S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}, \quad r \neq 1
   \]

**Working Rule to Solve Sequence and Series Problems**

1. **Identify the sequence type:** Determine if it is arithmetic, geometric, or another type.
2. **Find the general term \( a_n \):** Use the given pattern or formula.
3. **Calculate necessary terms:** Find particular terms if needed to understand the sequence progression.
4. **Form the series sum \( S_n \):** Apply the relevant sum formula or explicitly sum terms.
5. **Check conditions:** Verify restrictions such as \( r \neq 1 \) when using the geometric sum formula.
6. **Interpret results:** Analyze convergence in infinite series or compute exact sums for finite series.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

*Find the 5th term of the arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1=3 \) and common difference \( d=4 \).*

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify the formula for the \( n^{th} \) term of an arithmetic progression (AP):  
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
\]

Step 2: Substitute values \( n = 5 \), \( a_1 = 3 \), \( d = 4 \):  
\[
a_5 = 3 + (5 - 1) \times 4 = 3 + 16 = 19
\]

**Answer:** The 5th term is 19.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

*Determine the sum of the first 6 terms of the geometric sequence with \( a_1 = 2 \) and common ratio \( r = 3 \).*

**Solution:**

Step 1: Use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric progression (GP):  
\[
S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
\]

Step 2: Substitute \( a_1 = 2 \), \( r = 3 \), and \( n = 6 \):  
\[
S_6 = 2 \frac{1 - 3^6}{1 - 3} = 2 \frac{1 - 729}{1 - 3} = 2 \frac{-728}{-2} = 2 \times 364 = 728
\]

**Answer:** The sum of the first 6 terms is 728.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

*A sequence is defined by \( a_n = \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \). Find the sum of the first \( n \) terms.*

**Solution:**

Step 1: Express the general term as partial fractions:  
\[
\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}
\]

Step 2: Write the sum:  
\[
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)
\]

Step 3: Expand the terms:  
\[
S_n = \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}\right) + \cdots + \left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)
\]

Step 4: Notice telescoping cancellation:  
All intermediate terms cancel out, leaving  
\[
S_n = 1 - \frac{1}{n+1} = \frac{n}{n+1}
\]

**Answer:** Sum of the first \( n \) terms is \( \frac{n}{n+1} \).
