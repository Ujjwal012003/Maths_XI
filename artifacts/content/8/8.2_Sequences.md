**Introduction:**

Sequences are fundamental objects in mathematics comprising ordered lists of numbers. Understanding their nature, types, and general terms enables us to analyze patterns and solve a broad class of problems involving numerical progressions.

### 8.2.1 General Term of a Sequence

**Definition:**  
The **general term** or **\( n^{th} \) term** of a sequence is a formula that allows calculating the value of any term in the sequence based on its position \( n \). It is denoted as \( a_n \).

For a **geometric sequence**, defined by a first term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \), the general term is:

$$
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
Each term corresponds to a point \( (n, a_n) \) on the Cartesian plane. The sequence can be visualized as isolated points aligned with integer \( x \)-values. For geometric sequences:

- If \( |r| > 1 \), the terms increase exponentially, showing points rising steeply.
- If \( 0 < |r| < 1 \), the points decrease approaching zero.
- If \( r < 0 \), the sequence alternates in sign, creating points above and below the axis.

### 8.2.2 Types of Sequences

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.2.3:</b> Comparison of arithmetic (linear) and geometric (exponential) sequences graphically</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**1. Arithmetic Sequence (AP):**

A sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. The general term is

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,
$$

where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference.

**Proof of property:**  
Difference between consecutive terms:

$$
a_{n+1} - a_n = [a_1 + n d] - [a_1 + (n-1) d] = d.
$$

Thus, the difference \( d \) is constant.

---

**2. Geometric Sequence (GP):**

A sequence where the ratio of consecutive terms is constant. The general term is

$$
a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1},
$$

where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.

**Proof of property:**  
Ratio between consecutive terms:

$$
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{a_1 r^{n}}{a_1 r^{n-1}} = r.
$$

Hence, the ratio \( r \) is constant.

---

**3. Fibonacci Sequence:**

Defined recursively by

$$
F_1 = 1, \quad F_2 = 1, \quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}, \quad n > 2.
$$

Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.2.4:</b> Illustration contrasting finite and infinite sequences</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Finite Sequence:**  
A sequence with a limited number of terms. For example,

$$
\{a_n\} = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}
$$

contains 4 terms only and terminates.

**Proof:**  
The sequence is explicitly defined for \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) and no terms exist for \( n > 4 \), confirming finiteness.

---

**Infinite Sequence:**  
A sequence which continues indefinitely without end.

Example:

$$
a_n = n, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots,
$$

with terms \( 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots \).

**Proof:**  
For every natural number \( n \), a corresponding term \( a_n \) exists, hence the sequence never terminates.

---

**Formulas & Working Rule:**

**Formulas:**

1. Arithmetic sequence general term:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

2. Geometric sequence general term:

$$
a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}
$$

3. Fibonacci sequence recursive definition:

$$
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
$$

4. Notation for finite sequences:

$$
\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}
$$

5. Notation for infinite sequences:

$$
\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty
$$

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for problems involving sequences:**

1. **Identify the type** of sequence (arithmetic, geometric, recursive, or others).

2. **Find the general term** using given data or sequence properties.

3. **Check sequence length: finite or infinite** based on domain of definition.

4. **Calculate specific terms or sums** where required, applying formulas or recursive relations.

5. **Verify special cases:** for example, division by zero or out-of-domain indices.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Find the 7th term of the arithmetic sequence where \( a_1 = 5 \) and \( d = 3 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Use the formula for the general term:

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.
$$

Step 2: Substitute \( n = 7 \), \( a_1 = 5 \), and \( d = 3 \):

$$
a_7 = 5 + (7 - 1) \times 3 = 5 + 18 = 23.
$$

**Answer:** The 7th term is 23.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Find the 5th term of the geometric sequence with \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 4 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Use the formula for the general term:

$$
a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}.
$$

Step 2: Substitute \( n = 5 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( r = 4 \):

$$
a_5 = 2 \times 4^{4} = 2 \times 256 = 512.
$$

**Answer:** The 5th term is 512.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given the Fibonacci sequence defined by \( F_1 = 1 \), \( F_2 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \), find \( F_6 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Calculate the terms iteratively:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F_3 &= F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2, \\
F_4 &= F_3 + F_2 = 2 + 1 = 3, \\
F_5 &= F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5, \\
F_6 &= F_5 + F_4 = 5 + 3 = 8.
\end{aligned}
\]

**Answer:** \( F_6 = 8 \).
