**Introduction:**

Graphical interpretation provides a visual understanding of sequences and series, making abstract concepts concrete. By placing terms of sequences on a graph or number line, their behavior and properties become apparent. This section explores the graphical representation of arithmetic and geometric progressions and illustrates how sums of series can be visualized.

### 8.7.1 Arithmetic Progression on Number Line

</figure>

**Concept:**  
An arithmetic progression (AP) can be visualized on the number line as points that are equally spaced, highlighting the constant difference \( d \) between consecutive terms. The first term \( a_1 \) is marked, and subsequent terms are obtained by moving a fixed distance \( d \) along the line.

**Example:**  
Consider the AP with \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( d = 3 \):

- First term at 2.
- Second term at \( 2 + 3 = 5 \).
- Third term at \( 5 + 3 = 8 \).
- Fourth term at \( 8 + 3 = 11 \), and so on.

**Importance:**  
This equally spaced distribution visually confirms the linear growth characteristic of APs and serves as an intuitive tool for understanding addition and difference patterns in sequences.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.7.3:</b> Terms of a geometric progression plotted on a coordinate plane showing exponential nature</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Concept:**  
A geometric progression (GP) plotted on a graph with term number \( n \) on the x-axis and term value \( a_n \) on the y-axis generates points on an exponential curve. Depending on the common ratio \( r \):

- For \( r > 1 \), the curve rises steeply.
- For \( 0 < r < 1 \), the curve falls approaching zero.
- For negative \( r \), the plot oscillates between positive and negative values.

**Example:**  
Take \( a = 1 \), \( r = 2 \):

- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 = 4 \)
- \( a_4 = 8 \)

These points, when connected, form an exponential curve rising swiftly.

**Importance:**  
This visual representation aids in grasping the multiplicative nature of GP and the concept of exponential growth or decay, foundational in scientific modeling.

### 8.7.3 Visualization of Series Sums

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 8.7.4:</b> Representation of the sum of the first \( n \) terms as an aggregate area</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Concept:**  
The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a sequence can be visualized as an accumulation or area under discrete rectangles representing each term's value.

- For AP, the rectangles have increasing heights linearly spaced.
- For GP, the rectangle heights change exponentially.

**Example:**  
For the first 5 terms of \( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \) (GP),

- Draw rectangles of width 1 and heights 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
- The total area (sum) grows exponentially with \( n \).

**Importance:**  
Visualizing sums as areas helps in understanding convergence (for infinite series) and intuitively grasps why certain infinite series have finite sums.

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Graphical Interpretation Problems

1. Identify the type of sequence (AP or GP).

2. Plot the terms as points:

   - AP terms spaced equally on the number line.
   - GP terms plotted as points on an exponential curve.

3. For series sums, visualize each term as a rectangle/bar with height equal to the term value.

4. Analyze the pattern (linear or exponential growth/decay).

5. Use the graph to predict future terms or to intuitively assess sums and convergence where appropriate.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Plot the first 6 terms of AP \( 3, 6, 9, \ldots \) on the number line.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify \( a_1 = 3 \), \( d = 3 \).

Step 2: Mark points at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 on the number line equally spaced by 3.

Answer: Points on the number line demonstrate uniform spacing characteristic of AP.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Plot the first 5 terms of GP \( 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 \) on the Cartesian plane.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Calculate points: (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 16), (5, 32).

Step 2: Plot these points showing exponential growth.

Answer: The plotted points lie on an exponential curve.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Visualize the sum of the first 4 terms of GP \( 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8} \) as areas.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Bars/rectangles of height 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and width 1 are drawn.

Step 2: Sum area is \( 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 1.875 \).

Step 3: Observe how areas shrink creating a finite sum representation.

Answer: Visual awareness of series sum aids understanding of convergence.
