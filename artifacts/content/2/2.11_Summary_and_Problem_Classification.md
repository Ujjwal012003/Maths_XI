   - Examples: solving linear equations, basic derivatives or integrals, straightforward vector operations.

2. **Intermediate (Competency / Moderate):**  
   - Problems requiring combination of multiple steps or concepts.  
   - Examples: evaluating definite integrals after substitution, determinants involving parameters, chain rule with implicit differentiation.

3. **HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills / Challenging):**  
   - Complex problems demanding deep understanding, synthesis of multiple topics, and creative strategies.

4. **Plan your solution steps:**  
   - Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.  
   - Aim to simplify expressions systematically.

5. **Execute calculations carefully:**

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.11.4:</b> Table of central formulas covering differentiation, integration, vectors, and matrices</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Differentiation

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left(x^n\right) = nx^{n-1}
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left[\sin x\right] = \cos x, \quad \frac{d}{dx} \left[\cos x\right] = - \sin x
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left[\ln x\right] = \frac{1}{x}
\]

**Chain Rule:**

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
\]

#### Integration

Indefinite integral formulas:

\[
\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C, \quad n \neq -1
\]

\[
\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln |x| + C
\]

Integration by parts:

\[
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\]

Definite integrals for area between curve and axis:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx
\]

#### Matrices and Determinants

Determinant of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc
\]

Inverse of a \(2 \times 2\) matrix (if determinant \(\neq 0\)):

\[
A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad - bc} 
\begin{bmatrix}
d & -b \\
-c & a
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### Vector Algebra

Dot product:

\[
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}| \cos \theta = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3
\]

Cross product:

\[

### 2.11.5 Graded Solved Examples

---

#### Example 1 (Basic / Concept Building)  
**Problem:** Find the derivative of \(f(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 - 4x + 7\).

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Recall the power rule for differentiation.

- **Step 2:** Differentiate each term separately:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left(x^3\right) = 3x^2
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left(5x^2\right) = 5 \times 2 x = 10x
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx} (-4x) = -4
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx} (7) = 0
\]

- **Step 3:** Combine all differentiated terms:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 + 10x - 4
\]

---

#### Example 2 (Intermediate / Competency Based)  
**Problem:** Evaluate the definite integral

\[
I = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^2 x \, dx
\]

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Use the identity

\[
\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}
\]

- **Step 2:** Substitute the identity into the integral:

\[
I = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (1 - \cos 2x) \, dx
\]

- **Step 3:** Integrate each term separately:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 1 \, dx = \left[x\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos 2x \, dx = \left[\frac{\sin 2x}{2}\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{\sin \pi}{2} - \frac{\sin 0}{2} = 0
\]

- **Step 4:** Combine the results:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - 0\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

---

#### Example 3 (HOTS / Master Problem)  
**Problem:** Find the area bounded by the curve \(y^2 = 4ax\) and the line \(x = a\).

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Understand the region; the parabola opens rightwards, and the vertical line at \(x = a\) serves as a boundary.

- **Step 2:** Express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = \pm 2\sqrt{ax}
\]

- **Step 3:** The area enclosed between \(x=0\) and \(x=a\) bounded by the curve is:

\[
A = \int_0^a \left( \text{upper curve} - \text{lower curve} \right) dx = \int_0^a \left( 2\sqrt{ax} - (-2\sqrt{ax}) \right) dx = \int_0^a 4 \sqrt{ax} \, dx
\]

- **Step 4:** Simplify the integral:

\[
4 \sqrt{a} \int_0^a \sqrt{x} \, dx = 4 \sqrt{a} \int_0^a x^{\frac{1}{2}} \, dx
\]

- **Step 5:** Evaluate the integral:

\[
\int_0^a x^{\frac{1}{2}} \, dx = \left[ \frac{2}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right]_0^a = \frac{2}{3} a^{\frac{3}{2}}
\]

- **Step 6:** Multiply and simplify:

\[
A = 4 \sqrt{a} \times \frac{2}{3} a^{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{8}{3} a^{2}
\]

**Note:** In all problems, always ensure that denominators are non-zero and domain conditions are respected to guarantee validity of the solution.
