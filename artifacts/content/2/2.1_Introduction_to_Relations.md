Relations are fundamental in mathematics for establishing connections between elements of one set with elements of another or the same set. These connections help model a variety of mathematical and real-world situations, from linking students to their grades to pairing cities with temperatures. Understanding relations prepares the foundation for the study of functions and mappings.

### 2.1.1 Definition of Relations and Geometric Interpretation

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.1.1:</b> Relation as subset of Cartesian product A × B</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Given two non-empty sets \(A\) and \(B\), the **Cartesian product** \(A \times B\) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\). Formally,  
\[
A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\}.
\]  
A **relation** \(R\) from set \(A\) to set \(B\) is any subset of \(A \times B\):  
\[
R \subseteq A \times B.
\]  
Each element of \(R\) is an ordered pair \((a,b)\) indicating that \(a\) is related to \(b\) by the relation \(R\).

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Consider \(A\) and \(B\) as sets of numbers on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. Every ordered pair \((a,b) \in R\) can be represented as a point on the Cartesian plane at coordinate \((a, b)\). Thus, a relation corresponds to a set of points in the plane. This geometric representation helps visualize how elements of one set correspond to elements of another.

### 2.1.2 Ordered Pairs and Their Notation

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.1.2:</b> Representation and notation of ordered pairs</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Ordered Pair:**  
An **ordered pair** \((a, b)\) is a pair of elements where the order matters. It means \((a, b)\) is different from \((b, a)\) unless \(a = b\). The first element \(a\) is called the **first coordinate**, and the second element \(b\) is called the **second coordinate**.

**Notation:**  
Parentheses are used with a comma separating the two elements:  
\[
(a, b).
\]  
This notation is fundamental because it allows us to distinguish relations and functions where order conveys meaning, for example, input-output pairs in functions.

### 2.1.3 Representation of Relations

</figure>

Relations between sets can be represented in various ways to facilitate understanding and analysis:

**1. Set of Ordered Pairs**  
A relation \(R\) is defined explicitly as a collection of ordered pairs:  
\[
R = \{(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_n, b_n)\}.
\]  
This is a direct and complete description of the relation.

**2. Arrow Diagram**  
We place elements of set \(A\) and set \(B\) as points (nodes) on two parallel lines and draw arrows from elements in \(A\) to elements in \(B\) to indicate relation pairs. This visually represents how elements correspond without enumerating pairs explicitly.

**3. Cartesian Product Visualization**  
Since \(R \subseteq A \times B\), it can be visualized on the Cartesian plane by plotting all the points \((a,b)\) corresponding to pairs in \(R\). This is especially useful when \(A\) and \(B\) are numerical sets.

**Bold Text Theorem 1 (Relation is a Subset of Cartesian Product):**  
\[
\boxed{
\text{Every relation } R \text{ from } A \text{ to } B \text{ is a subset of } A \times B.
}
\]

**Bold Text Proof:**  
**Step 1:** By definition, an ordered pair \((a,b)\) belongs to the Cartesian product \(A \times B\) if and only if \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\).  
**Step 2:** A relation \(R\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is defined as a collection of such ordered pairs where each pair shows a connection between an element of \(A\) and an element of \(B\).  
**Step 3:** Since every element of \(R\) is an ordered pair \((a,b)\) with \(a \in A\) and \(b \in B\), it follows that \(R \subseteq A \times B\).  
Hence proved.

### Formulas Related to Relations

\[
\begin{aligned}
&A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A, b \in B\}, \\
&|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B| \quad \text{(Cardinality of Cartesian product)}, \\
&R \subseteq A \times B \quad \text{(Relation as subset)}, \\
&\text{Domain of } R = \{a \in A \mid (a,b) \in R \text{ for some } b \in B\}, \\
&\text{Range of } R = \{b \in B \mid (a,b) \in R \text{ for some } a \in A\}.
\end{aligned}
\]

### Working Rule (Algorithm) to Analyze Relations

1. **Identify sets**: Determine sets \(A\) and \(B\) involved in the relation.  
2. **Find Cartesian product**: List or identify all ordered pairs in \(A \times B\).  
3. **Determine relation pairs**: Identify which ordered pairs are included in relation \(R\).  
4. **Use representation**:  
    - Write out the set of ordered pairs explicitly.  
    - Or draw the arrow diagram mapping elements from \(A\) to \(B\).  
    - Or plot points on the Cartesian plane for \(A \times B\) and highlight points belonging to \(R\).  
5. **Analyze relation properties** (if needed): Check if each element in domain corresponds to one or more elements in range, etc.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Basic):**  
Let \(A = \{1, 2\}\) and \(B = \{3, 4\}\). Define relation \(R = \{(1, 3), (2, 4)\}\). Represent \(R\) using:  
(a) Set of ordered pairs  
(b) Arrow diagram  
(c) Cartesian plane plot

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Write ordered pairs directly:  
\[
R = \{(1,3), (2,4)\}.
\]  
**Step 2:** Draw two parallel lists for sets \(A\) and \(B\), then draw arrows:  
- From 1 in \(A\) to 3 in \(B\)  
- From 2 in \(A\) to 4 in \(B\)  
**Step 3:** On Cartesian plane, plot points \((1, 3)\) and \((2, 4)\).  
This visually confirms the relation.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Given \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\), \(B = \{a, b\}\), and relation  
\[
R = \{(1,a), (3,a), (3,b)\}
\]  
Find:  
(a) Domain of \(R\)  
(b) Range of \(R\)  
(c) Whether \(R\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\)

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Domain = all first elements of ordered pairs:  
\[
\text{Domain} = \{1, 3\}.
\]  
**Step 2:** Range = all second elements of ordered pairs:  
\[
\text{Range} = \{a, b\}.
\]  
**Step 3:** Checking if \(R\) is a function:  
For \(R\) to be a function, each element of \(A\) should relate to exactly one element of \(B\). Here, element 3 relates to both \(a\) and \(b\).  
So, \(R\) is **not** a function.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\), \(B = \{4, 5, 6\}\), and relation \(R\) be defined as:  
\[
(a,b) \in R \text{ if and only if } a + b = 7.
\]  
Represent \(R\) as a set of ordered pairs and plot on Cartesian plane.

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Calculate all pairs \((a,b)\) with \(a \in A\), \(b \in B\), summing to 7:  
- \(1 + 6 = 7\) \(\Rightarrow (1,6) \in R\)  
- \(2 + 5 = 7\) \(\Rightarrow (2,5) \in R\)  
- \(3 + 4 = 7\) \(\Rightarrow (3,4) \in R\)  
**Step 2:** So,  
\[
R = \{(1,6), (2,5), (3,4)\}.
\]  
**Step 3:** Plot these points on Cartesian plane: points \((1,6)\), \((2,5)\), \((3,4)\) lie on the line \(x + y = 7\).  
This shows a relation defined by a linear equation.
