Relations on a set can possess different properties that describe how elements relate to one another. Identifying and understanding these properties are crucial in advanced mathematics, foundations of functions, and equivalence classes. Here, we explore the types of relations commonly studied: reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and equivalence relations.

### 2.2.1 Reflexive Relations

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.2.1:</b> Reflexive relation visualized by elements related to themselves lying on the diagonal \(y=x\)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
A relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) is called **reflexive** if every element of \(A\) is related to itself. Formally,  
\[
\forall a \in A, \quad (a,a) \in R.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  
On the Cartesian plane representing \(A \times A\), reflexivity means that all points lying on the diagonal line \(y = x\) must be included in the relation. These are points where the first and second coordinates are equal, indicating elements are related to themselves.

**Bold Text Theorem 1:**  
\[
\boxed{
R \text{ is reflexive } \iff \forall a \in A, (a,a) \in R.
}
\]

**Bold Text Proof:**  
**Step 1:** Assume \(R\) is reflexive. By definition, each element \(a \in A\) must satisfy \((a,a) \in R\).  
**Step 2:** Conversely, if \((a,a) \in R\) for all \(a \in A\), then by definition \(R\) is reflexive.  
Thus, the two statements are equivalent.

### 2.2.2 Symmetric Relations

</figure>

**Definition:**  
A relation \(R\) on set \(A\) is **symmetric** if whenever an element \(a\) is related to \(b\), then \(b\) is also related to \(a\). Formally,  
\[
\forall a,b \in A, \quad (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  
On the Cartesian plane, symmetry means if the point \((a,b)\) is in \(R\), then its reflection \((b,a)\) about the diagonal line \(y = x\) is also in \(R\). Thus, the set of points in the relation is symmetric about this line.

---

**Bold Text Theorem 2:**  
\[
\boxed{
R \text{ is symmetric } \iff (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R \quad \forall a,b \in A.
}
\]

**Bold Text Proof:**  
**Step 1:** Suppose \(R\) is symmetric. Then by definition, presence of \((a,b)\) in \(R\) guarantees \((b,a) \in R\).  
**Step 2:** Conversely, if for every pair \((a,b) \in R\), the pair \((b,a)\) also belongs to \(R\), then \(R\) satisfies the property of symmetry.  
Hence, the two statements are logically equivalent.

### 2.2.3 Transitive Relations

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.2.3:</b> Transitive relation shown by chained arrows from \(a\) to \(b\) and \(b\) to \(c\) implies \(a\) to \(c\)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
A relation \(R\) on set \(A\) is **transitive** if whenever \(a\) is related to \(b\), and \(b\) is related to \(c\), then \(a\) is related to \(c\). Formally,  
\[
\forall a,b,c \in A, \quad (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  
This reflects connection chains on the Cartesian plane or in arrow diagrams: if an arrow leads from \(a\) to \(b\), and from \(b\) to \(c\), then there must be a direct arrow from \(a\) to \(c\).

---

**Bold Text Theorem 3:**  
\[
\boxed{
R \text{ is transitive } \iff (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R \quad \forall a,b,c \in A.
}
\]

**Bold Text Proof:**  
**Step 1:** Suppose \(R\) is transitive. Then by definition the relation must include \((a,c)\) whenever \((a,b)\) and \((b,c)\) are in \(R\).  
**Step 2:** Conversely, if the condition above holds true for all triples in \(A\), then \(R\) satisfies transitivity.   
Hence, the equivalence is established.

### 2.2.4 Equivalence Relations (Brief Introduction)

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.2.4:</b> Equivalence relation characterized by reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
A relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) is an **equivalence relation** if it is simultaneously reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Equivalence relations are foundational as they partition sets into equivalence classes where elements related to each other form subsets with special properties.

### Formulas Summary for Relations on Set \(A\):

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Reflexive:} && \forall a \in A, (a,a) \in R, \\
&\text{Symmetric:} && (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R, \\
&\text{Transitive:} && (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R, \\
&\text{Equivalence Relation:} && R \text{ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive}.
\end{aligned}
\]

### Working Rule (Algorithm) to Identify Relation Types

1. **Given:** A relation \(R\) on set \(A\).  
2. **Check Reflexivity:** Verify for each \(a \in A\) if \((a,a) \in R\). If yes for all, \(R\) is reflexive.  
3. **Check Symmetry:** For each \((a,b) \in R\), check if \((b,a) \in R\). If true for all, \(R\) is symmetric.  
4. **Check Transitivity:** For all \((a,b), (b,c) \in R\), verify \((a,c) \in R\). If yes for all, \(R\) is transitive.  
5. **Equivalence:** If all above three hold, then \(R\) is an equivalence relation.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and  
\[
R = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)\}.
\]  
Determine whether \(R\) is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Reflexivity - Check if \((a,a) \in R\) for \(a=1,2,3\). All three pairs \((1,1), (2,2), (3,3)\) are present. So, \(R\) is reflexive.  
**Step 2:** Symmetry - Check pairs:  
- \((1,2) \in R\) and \((2,1) \in R\); condition holds.  
- No other off-diagonal pairs exist. So, \(R\) is symmetric.  
**Step 3:** Transitivity - Check combinations:  
- \((1,2)\) and \((2,1)\) are in \(R\), is \((1,1)\) present? Yes.  
- All other necessary chains also satisfy transitivity.  
**Conclusion:** \(R\) is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive; therefore, an equivalence relation.

---

**Example 2 (Competency):**  
Let \(A = \{a,b,c\}\) and  
\[
R = \{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (a,b), (b,a), (a,c)\}.
\]  
Is \(R\) symmetric and transitive?

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Symmetry - \((a,b) \in R\) and \((b,a) \in R\), so symmetric holds for these pairs.  
However, \((a,c) \in R\) but \((c,a) \notin R\), so \(R\) is **not symmetric**.  
**Step 2:** Transitivity - Consider pairs:  
- \((a,b)\), \((b,a)\) included; \((a,a)\) present as well.  
- No counterexamples found for transitivity involving \(c\).  
Thus, \(R\) is transitive for the existing pairs.  
**Conclusion:** \(R\) is transitive but not symmetric.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Consider \(A = \{1,2,3\}\) and relation  
\[
R = \{(x,y) : x \leq y\}.
\]  
Check whether \(R\) is reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and if it is an equivalence relation.

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Reflexive: For all \(a\), \(a \leq a\) holds true, so \(R\) is reflexive.  
**Step 2:** Symmetric: Does \(x \leq y\) imply \(y \leq x\)? No, unless \(x = y\), so \(R\) is not symmetric.  
**Step 3:** Transitive: If \(x \leq y\) and \(y \leq z\), then \(x \leq z\), so \(R\) is transitive.  
**Step 4:** Equivalence relation requires all three properties; since \(R\) is not symmetric, it is **not** an equivalence relation.
