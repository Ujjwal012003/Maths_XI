Functions are fundamental mathematical objects, and performing operations on them helps build more complex functions and analyze their behaviors. This section explores operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition, along with crucial properties such as the fact that the composition of functions is itself a function.

**Definitions:**

1. **Addition:**  
For two functions \( f \) and \( g \) defined on the same domain, the sum \( (f+g) \) is defined by  
\[
(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x).
\]

2. **Subtraction:**  
The difference \( (f-g) \) is defined by  
\[
(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x).
\]

3. **Multiplication:**  
The product \( (fg) \) is given by  
\[
(fg)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x).
\]

4. **Division:**  
Provided \( g(x) \neq 0 \), the quotient \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right) \) is  
\[
\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}.
\]

**Geometric Interpretation:**  
These operations combine the outputs of \( f \) and \( g \) pointwise. Graphically, \( (f+g)(x) \) is obtained by adding the y-values of \( f \) and \( g \), etc. Multiplication and division produce transformations with distinct visual characteristics corresponding to product and ratio effects on the functions.

### 2.7.2 Composition of Functions

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 2.7.2:</b> Composition \( (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) \), mapping through intermediate function</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Given functions \( g: A \to B \) and \( f: B \to C \), the composition \( (f \circ g): A \to C \) is defined as  
\[
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
\]  
for all \( x \in A \).

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Composition can be visualized as applying \( g \) first to transform the input \( x \) in \( A \) to \( g(x) \) in \( B \), then applying \( f \) to map \( g(x) \) in \( B \) to \( f(g(x)) \) in \( C \).

---

**Bold Text Theorem:** Composition of Functions is a Function

\[
\boxed{
\text{If } f: B \to C \text{ and } g: A \to B \text{ are functions, then } f \circ g: A \to C \text{ is a function.}
}
\]

**Bold Text Proof:**

**Step 1:** Since \( g \) is a function, for each \( x \in A \), \( g(x) \) is uniquely defined in \( B \).

**Step 2:** Given \( f \) is a function, for each element \( y \in B \), \( f(y) \) is uniquely defined in \( C \).

**Step 3:** Thus, for every \( x \in A \), the value \( f(g(x)) \) is uniquely defined in \( C \).

**Step 4:** This satisfies the definition of a function from \( A \) to \( C \), hence \( f \circ g \) is a function.

### Formulas Summary:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x), \\
&(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x), \\
&(f \cdot g)(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x), \\
&\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, \quad g(x) \neq 0, \\
&(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)).
\end{aligned}
\]

### Working Rule (Algorithm) to Perform Operations and Composition:

1. **Step 1:** Identify the domain common to both functions \( f \) and \( g \).  
2. **Step 2:** For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, apply the formulas directly for each \( x \) in the domain (exclude points where denominator is zero for division).  
3. **Step 3:** For composition \( f \circ g \), first compute \( g(x) \) for \( x \), then apply \( f \) to the result \( g(x) \).  
4. **Step 4:** Ensure the output \( g(x) \) lies in the domain of \( f \) to validate \( f(g(x)) \).  
5. **Step 5:** Write the resulting function explicitly, simplifying where possible.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Let \( f(x) = x + 2 \) and \( g(x) = 3x \). Find \( (f+g)(x) \) and \( (f \circ g)(x) \).

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Add functions:  
\[
(f+g)(x) = (x + 2) + (3x) = 4x + 2.
\]  
**Step 2:** Compose functions:  
\[
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(3x) = 3x + 2.
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Given \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \), find \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(4) \) and \( (g \circ f)(4) \).

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Compute \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(4) \):  
\[
\frac{f(4)}{g(4)} = \frac{16}{2} = 8.
\]  
**Step 2:** Compute \( (g \circ f)(4) \):  
\[
g(f(4)) = g(16) = \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), \( g(x) = x - 1 \). Find the domain of \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x) \) and evaluate \( (f \circ g)(2) \).

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) undefined at \( x=0 \), \( g(x) = x-1 \) defined for all real \( x \).  
**Step 2:** For \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{x-1} = \frac{1}{x(x-1)} \), the domain excludes \( x=0 \) and \( x=1 \).  
**Step 3:** For composition:  
\[
(f \circ g)(2) = f(g(2)) = f(2 - 1) = f(1) = 1.
\]
