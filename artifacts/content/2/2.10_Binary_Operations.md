### 2.10.1 Definition of Binary Operations

**Intuition:**  
A binary operation is a rule that takes two elements from a set and combines them to produce another element, usually belonging to the same set. This idea generalizes common operations like addition and multiplication.

**Formal Definition:**  
Let \( A \) be a non-empty set. A **binary operation** on \( A \) is a function  
\[
* : A \times A \to A
\]
which assigns to each ordered pair \( (a, b) \in A \times A \) an element \( a * b \) in \( A \).

Here, \( A \times A \) is the Cartesian product of \( A \) with itself, i.e., the set of all ordered pairs of elements in \( A \).

**Geometric Meaning:**  
If we think of the set \( A \) as points in a plane or any geometric space, then a binary operation takes two points \( (a, b) \) and outputs a point \( c = a * b \) in the same space. This can be visualized as an "operation arrow" from the pair \( (a, b) \) to the element \( c \).

### 2.10.2 Examples and Verification on a Set

**Example 1: Addition on Integers**  
Let \( A = \mathbb{Z} \) (the set of all integers). Define \( + \) by  
\[
a + b = \text{sum of } a \text{ and } b.
\]  
Check this is a binary operation on \( \mathbb{Z} \):

- For any \( a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \), the sum \( a + b \) is also an integer.  
- Hence, \( + : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfies closure and is a binary operation.

---

**Example 2: Operation \( \star \) on set \( A = \{0,1,2\} \)**  
Define  
\[
a \star b = (a + b) \bmod 3.
\]  
Check if \( \star \) is a binary operation on \( A \):

- For any \( a, b \in A \), \( (a + b) \bmod 3 \in \{0,1,2\} \) because modular arithmetic output is within this set.  
- Thus, \( \star : A \times A \to A \) is a binary operation.

---

**Example 3: Subtraction on Natural Numbers \( A = \mathbb{N} \)**  
Define \( a \bullet b = a - b \). Check if this is a binary operation:

- Although \( a, b \in \mathbb{N} \), \( a - b \) may not be in \( \mathbb{N} \) if \( a < b \). For example, \( 2 - 3 = -1 \notin \mathbb{N} \).  
- Thus, subtraction is not a binary operation on \( \mathbb{N} \) as it is not closed.

---

**Verification Algorithm:**  
To verify a binary operation \(*\) on \( A \):

1. **Step 1:** For arbitrary elements \( a, b \in A \), apply the operation \( a * b \).  
2. **Step 2:** Check if the result belongs to set \( A \).  
3. **Step 3:** If true for all pairs \( (a, b) \), then \(*\) is a binary operation on \( A \); else, not.

---

### 2.10.3 Binary Operations as Functions from \( A \times A \) to \( A \)

To understand binary operations rigorously, it is essential to see them as functions.

**Definition:**  
A binary operation \(*\) on a set \( A \) is precisely a function  
\[
* : A \times A \to A,
\]
where \( A \times A \) is the domain (all ordered pairs of elements in \( A \)) and \( A \) is the codomain.

That is, the operation takes inputs \( (a,b) \) and produces a single output \( a * b \) in \( A \).

**Geometric/Functional Interpretation:**  
This view treats the binary operation as a well-defined mapping from the plane \( A \times A \) (the set of input pairs) to the set \( A \) (outputs). This function perspective guarantees operations are consistent and predictable.

---

### 2.10.4 Theorems and Properties

**Theorem:**  
*If \(*\) is a binary operation on a finite set \( A \), then the number of possible distinct binary operations on \( A \) is*  
\[
|A|^{|A|^{2}}.
\]

**Proof:**  

- Since \( A \) has \( n \) elements, \( |A| = n \).  
- The domain \( A \times A \) has \( n^2 \) ordered pairs.  
- Each ordered pair \( (a,b) \) must be mapped to one of \( n \) elements in \( A \).  
- Thus, the total number of functions \( A \times A \to A \) is \( n^{n^2} \).  
- Therefore, there are \( n^{n^{2}} \) binary operations on \( A \).

### 2.10.5 Working Rule (Algorithm) for Handling Binary Operations

1. **Step 1:** Identify the set \( A \) and the operation rule \(*\).  
2. **Step 2:** Verify closure by checking if \( a * b \in A \) for all pairs \( (a,b) \).  
3. **Step 3:** For any computation, substitute given values into the operation definition.  
4. **Step 4:** For functional description, express \(*\) as \(*: A \times A \to A\).  
5. **Step 5:** To construct or analyze tables for finite \( A \), list all \( (a,b) \) pairs and their \( a * b \) value to verify the operation's features.

### 2.10.6 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Given \( A = \{0,1\} \), define \( a * b = (a + b) \bmod 2 \). Is \(*\) a binary operation on \( A \)?

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Check pairs:  
  \((0,0): 0+0=0 \mod 2 = 0 \in A\).  
- **Step 2:** \((0,1): 0+1=1 \mod 2 = 1 \in A\).  
- **Step 3:** \((1,0): 1+0=1 \mod 2 = 1 \in A\).  
- **Step 4:** \((1,1): 1+1=2 \mod 2 = 0 \in A\).  
- **Step 5:** All outputs are in \( A \), so \(*\) is a binary operation on \( A \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Let \( A = \{0,1,2\} \). Define \( a \diamond b = (a \times b) \bmod 3 \). Verify closure and compute \( 2 \diamond 2 \).

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Closure: For any \( a,b \in A \), \( a \times b \in \{0,1,2,4,\ldots\} \). Modulo 3 brings the result back to \( A \).  
- **Step 2:** Calculate \( 2 \diamond 2 = (2 \times 2) \bmod 3 = 4 \bmod 3 = 1 \).  
- **Step 3:** Since all outcomes are in \( A \), closure holds and \( \diamond \) is a binary operation on \( A \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Let \( A = \{1, -1\} \) and define  
\[
a \star b = ab.
\]  
Is \(*\) a binary operation on \( A \)? Verify and find \( (-1) \star (-1) \).

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Check closure: product of elements of \( A \) is \( \pm 1 \), which remain in \( A \).  
- **Step 2:** \( (-1) \star (-1) = (-1) \times (-1) = 1 \in A \).  
- **Step 3:** Therefore, \(*\) is a binary operation on \( A \).
