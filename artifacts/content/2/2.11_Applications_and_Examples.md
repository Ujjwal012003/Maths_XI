### 2.11.1 Determining if a Relation is a Function

**Intuition:**  
A function is a special kind of relation where each input corresponds to exactly one output. Determining whether a given relation is a function involves checking the uniqueness of outputs for each input.

**Formal Definition:**  
A relation \( R \) from a set \( A \) to a set \( B \) is a **function** if for every \( a \in A \), there exists exactly one \( b \in B \) such that \( (a, b) \in R \).

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Graphically, a relation is a function if and only if any vertical line drawn through its graph intersects it at most once. This is known as the **vertical line test**.

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Determine if a Relation is a Function:**

1. **Step 1:** Examine the given set of ordered pairs or the relation's graph.  
2. **Step 2:** For each input (x-coordinate), check if there is more than one output (y-coordinate).  
3. **Step 3:** If every input corresponds to exactly one output, the relation is a function; otherwise, it is not.

---

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Given \( R = \{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)\} \), is \( R \) a function?

**Solution:**  
- Each input 1, 2, and 3 corresponds to exactly one output 4, 5, and 6 respectively.  
- Therefore, \( R \) is a function.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Given \( S = \{(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3)\} \), is \( S \) a function?

**Solution:**  
- Input 1 corresponds to two outputs, 4 and 5.  
- Hence, \( S \) is not a function.

---

### 2.11.2 Domain and Range Problem Solving

**Intuition:**  
The **domain** of a function is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined, while the **range** is the set of all possible outputs.

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Find Domain and Range:**

1. **Step 1:** Identify restrictions like denominators being zero or square roots of negative numbers.  
2. **Step 2:** Express these restrictions as inequalities or equations to exclude invalid inputs for the domain.  
3. **Step 3:** For the range, analyze the behavior of the function and possible output values, either algebraically or graphically.

---

**Example 3 (Concept Building):**  
Find the domain and range of \( f(x) = \frac{2x+3}{x-4} \).

**Solution:**

- **Domain:** Denominator cannot be zero: \( x \neq 4 \), so  
  \[
  \text{Domain} = (-\infty, 4) \cup (4, \infty).
  \]  
- **Range:** The function can take all real values except possibly some value corresponding to a horizontal asymptote; for this function, all real values are possible.  
  \[
  \text{Range} = (-\infty, \infty).
  \]

---

**Example 4 (Competency Based):**  
Find the domain and range of \( g(x) = \sqrt{x - 1} \).

**Solution:**

- **Domain:** Under the square root must be non-negative:  
  \[
  x - 1 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 1.
  \]  
  So the domain is  
  \[
  [1, \infty).
  \]  
- **Range:** Square root outputs non-negative values, so  
  \[
  [0, \infty).
  \]

---

### 2.11.3 Composition and Inverse Function Problems

**Intuition:**  
Function composition combines two functions by applying one function to the result of another. The inverse function reverses the operation of a function.

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for Composition:**  
1. **Step 1:** Calculate the inner function \( g(x) \).  
2. **Step 2:** Substitute \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \) to get \( f(g(x)) \).

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for Inverse Functions:**  
1. **Step 1:** Replace \( f(x) \) by \( y \).  
2. **Step 2:** Interchange \( x \) and \( y \).  
3. **Step 3:** Solve for \( y \).  
4. **Step 4:** Write the inverse function as \( f^{-1}(x) = y \).

---

**Example 5 (Concept Building):**  
Given \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 \), find \( (f \circ g)(2) \).

**Solution:**  
- Calculate \( g(2) = 2^2 = 4 \).  
- Then, \( f(g(2)) = f(4) = 2 \times 4 + 3 = 11 \).  
Hence, \( (f \circ g)(2) = 11 \).

---

**Example 6 (Competency Based):**  
Find the inverse of \( f(x) = 3x - 5 \).

**Solution:**  
- Replace \( f(x) \) with \( y \):  
  \[
  y = 3x - 5.
  \]  
- Swap \( x \) and \( y \):  
  \[
  x = 3y - 5.
  \]  
- Solve for \( y \):  
  \[
  3y = x + 5 \implies y = \frac{x + 5}{3}.
  \]  
- So,  
  \[
  f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{3}.
  \]

---

**Example 7 (HOTS):**  
If \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \), compute \( f^{-1}(f(3)) \).

**Solution:**

- Calculate \( f(3) = 2 \times 3 + 1 = 7 \).  
- Find \( f^{-1}(x) \):  
  \[
  y = 2x + 1 \implies x = 2y + 1 \implies y = \frac{x - 1}{2}.
  \]  
- Therefore,  
  \[
  f^{-1}(7) = \frac{7 - 1}{2} = 3.
  \]

### 2.11.4 Graphical Interpretation Exercises

**Intuition:**  
Graphical exercises help visualize functions, understand their behavior, and interpret their properties such as intercepts, increasing/decreasing behavior, and domains and ranges.

---

**Example 8 (Concept Building):**  
Graph the linear function \( y = 2x + 3 \).

**Solution:**

- Plot the \( y \)-intercept \( (0, 3) \).  
- Use slope \( m = 2 \): from \( (0, 3) \), move up 2 units and right 1 unit to \( (1, 5) \).  
- Draw a line through these points.

---

**Example 9 (Competency Based):**  
Graph the inequality \( 3x + 2y < 6 \).

**Solution:**

- Draw the boundary line \( 3x + 2y = 6 \).  
- Find intercepts: \( (0,3) \), \( (2,0) \).  
- Since inequality is strict (\(<\)), use a dashed line.  
- Test point \( (0,0) \):  
  \[
  3(0) + 2(0) = 0 < 6,
  \]  
  so shade the region containing \( (0,0) \).

---

**Example 10 (HOTS):**  
Graph \( y = x^2 - 4 \).

**Solution:**

- Vertex at \( (0, -4) \).  
- Plot points \( (1, -3) \), \( (-1, -3) \), \( (2, 0) \), \( (-2, 0) \).  
- Sketch a smooth parabola opening upwards through these points.
