### 1.8.1 Definition and Usage

**Introduction:**  

In set theory, the **universal set** serves as the complete universe under consideration for a given discussion. It contains all the elements relevant to the problem or context.

**Formal Definition:**  

The **universal set** \( U \) is the set that includes all possible elements under consideration. Every other set discussed in that context is a **subset** of \( U \). It is usually fixed for a particular discussion or problem.

---

### Geometric Meaning

On a Venn diagram, the universal set is represented by a rectangle or enclosing boundary. All subsets lie inside this boundary.

---

### 1.8.2 Relationship with Other Sets

**Subsets:**  

For any subset \( A \) of the universal set \( U \),  
\[
A \subseteq U.
\]

**Complement of a Set:**  

The **complement** of a set \( A \), denoted by \( A' \) or \( A^c \), consists of all elements of \( U \) that are not in \( A \):  
\[
A' = U - A = \{x : x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A\}.
\]

---

### 1.8.3 Theorems & Proofs

**Bold Text: Theorem 1:** For any subset \( A \) of universal set \( U \),  
\[
A \cup A' = U \quad \text{and} \quad A \cap A' = \emptyset.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Every element \( x \in U \) is either in \( A \) or not in \( A \).  
- **Step 2:** If \( x \in A \), then \( x \in A \cup A' \).  
- **Step 3:** If \( x \notin A \), then \( x \in A' \), hence \( x \in A \cup A' \).  
- **Step 4:** Thus, \( A \cup A' = U \).

- **Step 5:** By definition, no element is in both \( A \) and \( A' \).  
- **Step 6:** So, \( A \cap A' = \emptyset \).

---

### Formulas & Working Rule

- **Complement of a set:**  
  \[
  A' = U - A
  \]

- **Union with complement:**  
  \[
  A \cup A' = U
  \]

- **Intersection with complement:**  
  \[
  A \cap A' = \emptyset
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Solve Problems Involving Universal Set and Complements:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify the universal set \( U \) relevant to the problem.  
2. **Step 2:** For a given subset \( A \), find elements in \( A \) and \( U \setminus A \) (complement).  
3. **Step 3:** Use properties of union and intersection with complements to simplify expressions.  
4. **Step 4:** Verify results with Venn diagrams when possible.  
5. **Step 5:** Apply formulas for probabilities or set operations involving complements.

### 1.8.4 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Let \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \), and \( A = \{2, 4\} \). Find the complement \( A' \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:**  
  \[
  A' = U - A = \{1, 3, 5\}.
  \]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
If \( U = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\} \), and \( B = \{1,3,5,7,9\} \), find \( B \cup B' \) and \( B \cap B' \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:**  
  \[
  B' = U - B = \{2,4,6,8,10\}.
  \]
- **Step 2:**  
  \[
  B \cup B' = U
  \]
- **Step 3:**  
  \[
  B \cap B' = \emptyset
  \]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given \( U = \{a, b, c, d, e\} \), \( C = \{b, d\} \), find \( (C')' \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** First find  
  \[
  C' = U - C = \{a, c, e\}.
  \]
- **Step 2:** Then find complement of \( C' \):  
  \[
  (C')' = U - C' = \{b, d\} = C.
  \]

**Remarks:**  

The universal set concept and complement operation provide a powerful framework to analyze sets holistically. They are especially useful in probability, logic, and advanced set operations. Mastery of these concepts through practice is essential for students progressing in mathematics.
