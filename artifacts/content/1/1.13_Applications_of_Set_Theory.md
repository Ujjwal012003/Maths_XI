### 1.13.1 Problem Types Using Sets

**Introduction:**  

Set theory equips us with a versatile toolkit to solve a wide variety of problems involving collections of objects. Sets are used to model and analyze situations where elements share certain attributes or belong to multiple groups simultaneously.

**Common Problem Types:**  

- **Classification Problems:** Categorizing objects into sets based on properties.  
- **Counting Problems:** Determining the number of elements in sets involving unions and intersections.  
- **Membership Problems:** Verifying whether an element belongs to a set.  
- **Logical Reasoning:** Formulating proofs and arguments using set relations.

---

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Sets and their relations can be mapped graphically with Venn diagrams, enabling visual identification of overlapping or disjoint elements.

---

### 1.13.2 Venn Diagram Applications

**Definition:**  

A **Venn diagram** is a graphical tool that visually represents sets as closed curves, commonly circles, with overlapping regions denoting common elements among sets.

**Usage:**  

- To illustrate **union**, **intersection**, and **complement** operations.  
- To solve **problems involving three or more sets**.  
- To visually represent **complex set relationships** which may be algebraically or logically complicated.

**Bold Text: Theorems & Proofs**

**Theorem:**  
For any three sets \( A, B, C \), the number of elements in the union can be expressed by the Inclusion-Exclusion principle:  
\[
|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |C \cap A| + |A \cap B \cap C|
\]

**Proof (Sketch):**  

1. Sum the sizes of the individual sets \( |A| + |B| + |C| \).  
2. Subtract sizes of pairwise intersections to correct double counting.  
3. Add size of triple intersection to compensate for elements subtracted too many times.

### 1.13.3 Basic Proofs with Sets

Sets enable formal proofs in mathematics, such as proving set equality, subset relations, and operation properties.

---

**Proof Example:**  

**To prove:**  
If \( A \subseteq B \) and \( B \subseteq C \), then \( A \subseteq C \).

**Proof:**  

1. Let \( x \in A \).  
2. Since \( A \subseteq B \), \( x \in B \).  
3. Since \( B \subseteq C \), \( x \in C \).  
4. Thus, \( A \subseteq C \).

### Formulas & Working Rule

- **Counting Union via Two Sets:**  
  \[
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
  \]
- **Counting Union via Three Sets:**  
  \[
  |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |C \cap A| + |A \cap B \cap C|
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for Solving Set Problems:**  

1. Identify the universal set and all relevant subsets.  
2. Determine what sets or combinations (union, intersection, difference) are involved.  
3. Use Venn diagrams to represent the problem visually.  
4. Apply inclusion-exclusion principle for counting elements.  
5. Carefully consider overlaps and correct counts accordingly.  
6. Use formal proof techniques to validate claims about sets.  
7. Interpret the results back in the context of the problem.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
In a class of 40 students, 18 play cricket, 15 play football, and 5 play both. Find the number of students who play either cricket or football.

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: Let \( C \) = cricket players, \( F \) = football players.  
- Step 2: Use formula:  
  \[
  |C \cup F| = |C| + |F| - |C \cap F| = 18 + 15 - 5 = 28.
  \]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Among 50 students, 20 study Math, 25 study Physics, and 10 study both. Find the number of students studying neither Math nor Physics.

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: Let \( M \) = Math, \( P \) = Physics.  
- Step 2: Calculate students studying Math or Physics:  
  \[
  |M \cup P| = 20 + 25 - 10 = 35.
  \]  
- Step 3: Students not studying either:  
  \[
  50 - 35 = 15.
  \]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
In a group of people, 60% liked movie A, 50% liked movie B, and 30% liked both. What percentage liked neither?

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: Using percentage notation, let \( A \) and \( B \) be sets of people liking each movie.  
- Step 2: Calculate union:  
  \[
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 60 + 50 - 30 = 80\%.
  \]  
- Step 3: Percentage liking neither:  
  \[
  100 - 80 = 20\%.
  \]

**Remarks:**  

Applications of set theory via Venn diagrams and rigorous proofs build both conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. These tools prepare students for more sophisticated explorations in mathematics and logic.
