### 1.12.1 Definition of Cardinality

**Introduction:**  

The **cardinality** of a set quantifies the number of elements in that set. It provides a numerical measure of the size of the set, whether finite or infinite.

**Formal Definition:**  

For any set \( A \), the **cardinality** of \( A \), denoted \( |A| \), is defined as the number of distinct elements in \( A \).

- If \( A \) is finite with elements \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), then  
  \[
  |A| = n.
  \]

- If \( A \) is infinite, its cardinality is not a finite number (this section focuses on finite sets).

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Cardinality corresponds to the count of points representing elements on the graph or diagram of the set.

---

### 1.12.2 Cardinality of Finite Sets

A **finite set** is a set with a countable number of elements.

- **Example:**  
  \( A = \{1, 3, 5, 7\} \) has cardinality \( |A| = 4 \).

- The empty set \( \emptyset \) has cardinality zero:  
  \[
  |\emptyset| = 0.
  \]

---

### 1.12.3 Formula for Cardinality of Union of Two Sets

**Theorem (Cardinality of Union):**  

For any two finite sets \( A \) and \( B \),  
\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Start with the total number of elements in \( A \) and \( B \):  
  \[
  |A| + |B|.
  \]

- **Step 2:** Elements in \( A \cap B \) are counted twice (once in \( |A| \), once in \( |B| \)).

- **Step 3:** Subtract \( |A \cap B| \) to correct double counting:  
  \[
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|.
  \]

---

### 1.12.4 Formula for Cardinality of Difference of Sets

**Theorem (Cardinality of Difference):**  

For finite sets \( A \) and \( B \),  
\[
|A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B|.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** The difference \( A - B \) consists of elements in \( A \) not in \( B \).

- **Step 2:** The elements counted in \( A \cap B \) overlap with \( B \).

- **Step 3:** Removing these gives:  
  \[
  |A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B|.
  \]

---

### Formulas & Working Rule

- Cardinality of union:  
  \[
  |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
  \]
- Cardinality of difference:  
  \[
  |A - B| = |A| - |A \cap B|
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Find Cardinalities:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify the elements and count elements in \( A \), \( B \), and \( A \cap B \).  
2. **Step 2:** Apply the formula for union or difference, depending on the operation.  
3. **Step 3:** Use Venn diagrams to visualize to avoid double counting.  
4. **Step 4:** Calculate the correct cardinality value.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Find the cardinality of the set \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).

**Solution:**  
Since \( A \) has four elements,  
\[
|A| = 4.
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
For \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), find \( |A \cup B| \).

**Solution:**  
Calculate:  
- \( |A| = 3 \),  
- \( |B| = 3 \),  
- \( |A \cap B| = |\{3\}| = 1 \).  

Apply formula:  
\[
|A \cup B| = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given \( A = \{a, b, c, d\} \), \( B = \{c, d, e, f\} \), find \( |A - B| \).

**Solution:**  
- \( |A| = 4 \),  
- \( |A \cap B| = |\{c, d\}| = 2 \).  

Applying formula:  
\[
|A - B| = 4 - 2 = 2.
\]

**Remarks:**  

Mastering cardinality fundamentals is vital for solving more complex set theory problems, including those involving multiple sets and operations. Understanding and applying counting methods with care prevents errors such as double counting.
