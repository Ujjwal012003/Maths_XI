In mathematics, functions connect each element of one set to elements of another set in various ways. Understanding the **types of functions** is crucial because they help characterize the nature of these connections — from those where each input corresponds uniquely to an output to complex polynomial and rational relationships. This section introduces the critical types of functions studied in Class 12.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.1:</b> One to one (injective) function and the horizontal line test</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

A function is *one to one* or **injective** if it assigns distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain. Informally, no two different inputs share the same output value.

**Definition**

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is called **one to one (injective)** if for any \( x_1, x_2 \in X \),

\[
f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2
\]

**Geometric Meaning**

Graphically, an injective function passes the **horizontal line test**: any horizontal line intersects the graph of \( f \) at most once. This ensures every value in the range is associated with a unique input.

---

**Theorem**  
\[
\boxed{
\text{If } f: X \to Y \text{ is injective, then } f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2.
}
\]

**Proof:**

1. Assume \( f \) is injective by definition.
2. For \( x_1, x_2 \in X \), suppose \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \).
3. By injectivity, this implies \( x_1 = x_2 \).
4. Hence the theorem holds by direct use of the definition.

---

**Standard Results**

For common functions:

- \( f(x) = mx + c \), \( m \neq 0 \) is injective.
- \( f(x) = e^x \) is injective.
- \( f(x) = x^2 \) over \(\mathbb{R}\) is not injective.

---

**Working Rule to Test Injectivity**

1. **Start:** Take two arbitrary inputs \( x_1, x_2 \).
2. Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \).
3. Simplify the equation algebraically.
4. If this yields \( x_1 = x_2 \) necessarily, then function is injective.
5. If not, find values \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) with \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \) → not injective.

---

**Examples**

**Example 1 (Basic):**  
Determine if \( f(x) = 3x + 7 \) is injective.

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \), so  
\[
3x_1 + 7 = 3x_2 + 7
\]  
Step 2: Subtracting 7 from both sides:  
\[
3x_1 = 3x_2
\]  
Step 3: Dividing by 3:  
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]  
Hence, \( f \) is injective.

---

**Example 2 (Conceptual):**  
Is \( f(x) = x^2 \) injective over \( \mathbb{R} \)?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Suppose \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \),  
\[
x_1^2 = x_2^2
\]  
Step 2: This implies  
\[
x_1 = x_2 \quad \text{or} \quad x_1 = -x_2
\]  
Since distinct \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) can yield same \( f(x) \) (e.g., \(2\) and \(-2\)), \( f \) is **not** injective.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Check if \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by \( f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+1} \), \( x \neq -1 \), is injective.

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \). So,  
\[
\frac{x_1 - 1}{x_1 + 1} = \frac{x_2 - 1}{x_2 + 1}
\]  
Step 2: Cross-multiplied,  
\[
(x_1 - 1)(x_2 + 1) = (x_2 - 1)(x_1 + 1)
\]  
Step 3: Expand both sides,  
\[
x_1 x_2 + x_1 - x_2 - 1 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 - x_1 - 1
\]  
Step 4: Cancel \( x_1 x_2 \) and \(-1\) terms,  
\[
x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_1
\]  
Step 5: Rearrange,  
\[
x_1 - x_2 - x_2 + x_1 = 0 \implies 2x_1 - 2x_2 = 0
\]  
Step 6: Hence,  
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]  
Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

---

### 1.4.2 Onto Function (Surjective)

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph showing onto function covering entire codomain" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.2:</b> Onto function mapping domain onto entire codomain</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is **onto (surjective)** if every element of the codomain \( Y \) has at least one pre-image in the domain \( X \). The function “covers” all of \( Y \).

**Definition**

\[
f: X \to Y \quad \text{is onto if} \quad \forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X \text{ such that } f(x) = y
\]

This means the **range** of \( f \) equals its codomain.

---

**Geometric Meaning**

Graphically, an onto function’s graph fills or “covers” the entire vertical span of the codomain. No value in \( Y \) is left unmapped or “uncovered.”

---

**Theorem**  
\[
\boxed{
f: X \to Y \text{ is onto} \iff \text{range}(f) = Y
}
\]

---

**Proof:**

1. Suppose \( f \) is onto.
2. By definition, for every \( y \in Y \), there is \( x \in X \) with \( f(x) = y \).
3. Hence, the set of outputs from \( f \) is exactly \( Y \), so \( \text{range}(f) = Y \).
4. Conversely, if \( \text{range}(f) = Y \), then every \( y \in Y \) comes from some \( x \in X \), so \( f \) is onto.

---

**Standard Results**

- \( f(x) = mx + c \), \( m \neq 0 \) is onto \( \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \).
- \( f(x) = e^x \) with codomain \( (0, \infty) \) is onto.

---

**Working Rule to Test Onto**

1. Identify codomain \( Y \) (target set).
2. Take an arbitrary \( y \in Y \).
3. Solve \( y = f(x) \) for \( x \).
4. If for every \( y \), you find \( x \) in domain satisfying the equation, \( f \) is onto.
5. If any \( y \) has no pre-image \( x \), then \( f \) is not onto.

---

**Examples**

**Example 1 (Basic):**  
Is \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \), \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \), onto?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let \( y \in \mathbb{R} \) be arbitrary.  
Step 2: Solve \( y = 2x + 3 \) for \( x \):  
\[
x = \frac{y - 3}{2}
\]  
Step 3: Since \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) for every \( y \), \( f \) is onto.

---

**Example 2 (Conceptual):**  
Is \( f(x) = x^2 \), \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \), onto?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let \( y \in \mathbb{R} \) be arbitrary.  
Step 2: Solve \( y = x^2 \) for \( x \).  
Step 3: If \( y \geq 0 \), solutions exist. For \( y < 0 \), no real \( x \) satisfies \( x^2 = y \).  
Step 4: Since negative real numbers in codomain have no pre-image, \( f \) is **not** onto.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Check if \( f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+1} \), \( x \neq -1 \), onto \( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\} \).

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Let \( y \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\} \).  
Step 2: Solve for \( x \) in  
\[
y = \frac{x-1}{x+1}
\]  
Cross-multiplied:  
\[
y(x + 1) = x - 1
\]  
\[
yx + y = x - 1
\]  
Step 3: Rearranged:  
\[
yx - x = -1 - y
\]  
\[
x(y - 1) = - (y + 1)
\]  
Step 4: If \( y \neq 1 \),  
\[
x = \frac{-(y+1)}{y-1}
\]  
Step 5: \( x \neq -1 \) since denominator in original function excludes it. Substitute \( x = -1 \) and check:  
\( f(-1) \) undefined, so no obstruction here.  
Step 6: Since for every \( y \neq 1 \), \( x \) exists, \( f \) is onto \( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\} \).

### 1.4.3 One to One Correspondence (Bijective)

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph showing bijective function with one-to-one and onto properties" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.3:</b> A bijective function: both injective and surjective</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

A function is a **one-to-one correspondence** or **bijective** if it is both injective and onto. This means it pairs each element of the domain with a unique element of the codomain and every codomain element is covered.

**Definition**

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is **bijective** if:

1. \( f \) is injective: \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2 \)
2. \( f \) is onto: for every \( y \in Y \), \( \exists x \in X \) such that \( f(x) = y \)

---

**Geometric Meaning**

The graph passes both the horizontal line test (injective) and covers the entire codomain (onto).

---

**Theorem**  
\[
\boxed{
\text{A function } f \text{ is bijective if and only if it has an inverse function } f^{-1}.
}
\]

---

**Proof:**

1. If \( f \) is bijective, every element of \( Y \) is mapped by exactly one element of \( X \).
2. Hence, we can define \( f^{-1}: Y \to X \) such that \( f^{-1}(y) = x \) where \( f(x) = y \).
3. Inverse function \( f^{-1} \) satisfies \( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(f^{-1}(y)) = y \).

Conversely, if an inverse \( f^{-1} \) exists, it implies unique pairing, so \( f \) is bijective.

---

**Working Rule to Check Bijectivity**

1. Check injectivity by verifying \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2 \).
2. Check onto by verifying \( \forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X: f(x) = y \).
3. If both hold, \( f \) is bijective.

---

**Examples**

**Example 1 (Basic):**  
Is \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) bijective from \( \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \)?

**Solution:**  
- Injective: Yes, already proved in 1.4.1  
- Onto: Yes, already proved in 1.4.2  
Hence, \( f \) is bijective.

---

**Example 2 (Conceptual):**  
Is \( f(x) = x^2 \), \( f: \mathbb{R}^+_0 \to \mathbb{R}^+_0 \) (non-negative reals to non-negative reals), bijective?

**Solution:**  
- Injective on \( \mathbb{R}^+_0 \) since \( x^2 = y^2 \implies x = y \) when \( x, y \geq 0 \).  
- Onto since every \( y \geq 0 \) has \( x = \sqrt{y} \).  
Thus, \( f \) is bijective.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Discuss bijectivity of \( f: \mathbb{R} \to (-1,1) \), defined by  
\[
f(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]

**Solution:**

- **Injective test:** Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \), implies  
\[
\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{1 + x_1^2}} = \frac{x_2}{\sqrt{1 + x_2^2}}
\]  
Since the function is strictly increasing (can be verified via derivative analysis), \( x_1 = x_2 \) implying injectivity.

- **Onto test:** For any \( y \in (-1,1) \), solve  
\[
y = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}
\]  
Rearranged:  
\[
y^2(1 + x^2) = x^2 \implies y^2 + y^2 x^2 = x^2
\]  
Grouping terms:  
\[
y^2 = x^2 - y^2 x^2 = x^2 (1 - y^2)
\]  
Thus,  
\[
x^2 = \frac{y^2}{1 - y^2}
\]  
Taking the positive root (since \( f \) is increasing),  
\[
x = \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]  
For every \( y \in (-1,1) \), such an \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) exists, hence onto.

Therefore, \( f \) is bijective.

---

### 1.4.4 Constant Function

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph of a constant function" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.4:</b> Constant function graph is a horizontal line</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

A **constant function** maps every input in the domain to the same fixed element in the codomain.

**Definition**

For a constant \( c \in Y \),

\[
f: X \to Y, \quad f(x) = c \quad \forall x \in X
\]

---

**Geometric Meaning**

The graph of a constant function is a horizontal line passing through \( y = c \).

---

**Properties**

- Constant functions are **not injective** unless domain has a single element.
- Constant functions may or may not be onto depending on \( Y \).

---

**Working Rule**

1. Identify constant value \( c \).
2. Check output matches \( c \) for any input.
3. For injectivity, since outputs don't differ, it's not one-to-one except trivial domains.
4. For onto, check if codomain \( Y = \{c\} \).

---

**Examples**

**Example 1:**  
\( f(x) = 5 \), \( \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \)

- Range = \(\{5\}\)
- If codomain = \(\mathbb{R}\), not onto.
- Not injective.

---

### 1.4.5 Identity Function

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph of the identity function" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.5:</b> Identity function graph is the line \( y=x \)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

The **identity function** maps every element to itself.

**Definition**

For set \( X \),

\[
Id_X: X \to X \quad \text{defined by} \quad Id_X(x) = x
\]

---

**Geometric Meaning**

Its graph is the straight line \( y = x \).

---

**Properties**

- Identity function is bijective.
- It is the inverse of itself.

---

**Working Rule**

1. Map input \( x \) directly to output \( x \).
2. Check injectivity: clearly \( x_1 = x_2 \) if outputs equal.
3. Check onto: every element is hit.

---

### 1.4.6 Polynomial and Rational Functions

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.4.6:</b> Examples of polynomial and rational functions</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Introduction**

Polynomial and rational functions are common and important in algebra and calculus. Polynomial functions are sums of powers with coefficients, while rational functions are ratios of polynomials.

---

**Polynomial Function**

**Definition:**  
A function

\[
f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0
\]

where \( a_n \neq 0 \), and \( n \) is a non-negative integer, is called a **polynomial function**.

---

**Rational Function**

**Definition:**  
A function

\[
f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
\]

where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomial functions and \( Q(x) \neq 0 \) in the domain.

---

**Geometric Meaning**

- Polynomial functions are smooth continuous curves.
- Rational functions may have discontinuities where denominators vanish.

---

**Theorems / Important Points**

- Polynomial functions of degree 1 (linear) are bijective from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\).
- Quadratic polynomials are not injective on whole domain but restricted domain can make it injective.
- Rational functions are defined only where denominator \( \neq 0 \).

---

**Working Rule to Analyze Polynomial/Rational Functions**

1. Identify degree and coefficients.
2. Check domain restrictions, especially zeros of denominator for rational functions.
3. Determine injectivity and surjectivity using methods in subsections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.
4. For complex compositions, consider piecewise functions or domain restrictions.

---

**Examples**

**Example 1:**  
Is \( f(x) = x^3 + 1 \) injective?

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \)  
\[
x_1^3 +1 = x_2^3 +1 \implies x_1^3 = x_2^3
\]  
Step 2: Cubic function is strictly increasing over \( \mathbb{R} \), so  
\[
x_1 = x_2
\]  
Hence \( f \) is injective.

---

**Example 2:**  
Find the domain of \( f(x) = \frac{x+1}{x^2 - 4} \).

**Solution:**  
Step 1: Denominator must not be zero:  
\[
x^2 - 4 \neq 0 \Rightarrow (x-2)(x+2) \neq 0
\]  
Step 2:  
\[
x \neq 2, \quad x \neq -2
\]  
Step 3: Domain is \(\mathbb{R} \setminus \{-2, 2\}\).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Determine whether \( f(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} \), \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), is injective.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Assume \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \), so  
\[
\frac{x_1}{x_1^2 + 1} = \frac{x_2}{x_2^2 + 1}
\]

Step 2: Cross-multiplied,  
\[
x_1 (x_2^2 + 1) = x_2 (x_1^2 + 1)
\]

Step 3: Expand,  
\[
x_1 x_2^2 + x_1 = x_2 x_1^2 + x_2
\]

Step 4: Rearrange,  
\[
x_1 x_2^2 - x_2 x_1^2 = x_2 - x_1
\]

Step 5: Factor terms appropriately:  
\[
x_1 x_2^2 - x_2 x_1^2 = (x_1 x_2)(x_2 - x_1)
\]

Hence,  
\[
(x_1 x_2)(x_2 - x_1) = x_2 - x_1
\]

Step 6: Consider two cases:

- Case 1: \( x_2 \neq x_1 \), dividing both sides by \( x_2 - x_1 \) gives  
\[
x_1 x_2 = 1
\]  
In this case, different inputs \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) satisfy equality.

- Case 2: \( x_2 = x_1 \) obviously satisfies the condition.

Step 7: Since case 1 shows distinct \( x_1, x_2 \) map to the same output, \( f \) is **not injective**.

This completes your reading on the types of functions including their formal definitions, geometric interpretations, key theorems with proofs, working rules to test properties, and a graded set of examples building from basics to higher level problems.

Mastering these concepts is essential for understanding more advanced topics in calculus and algebra, especially when dealing with inverse functions, transformations, and function compositions.
