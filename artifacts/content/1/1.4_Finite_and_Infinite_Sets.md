### 1.4.1 Definition of Finite Sets

**Introduction:**  

Some sets contain a *countable* number of elements. These are called **finite sets**. Think of these as sets where you can list and count all their elements explicitly.

**Formal Definition:**  

A set \( A \) is said to be **finite** if the number of distinct elements in \( A \) is some non-negative integer \( n \). That is, the elements of \( A \) can be counted as  
\[
A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}
\]
where \( n \geq 0 \). The number \( n \) is called the **cardinality** of \( A \), denoted by \( |A| = n \).

When \( n = 0 \), \( A \) is the **empty set**.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Geometrically, in a finite set, the elements can be represented as isolated points in a space, such as points on a number line, with a limited number of points.

### 1.4.2 Definition of Infinite Sets

**Introduction:**  

Conversely, some sets have elements that never end; you cannot exhaustively list all their elements. Such sets are called **infinite sets**.

**Formal Definition:**  

A set \( B \) is called **infinite** if it is not finite; that is, it has infinitely many elements and its cardinality cannot be expressed as a finite integer. Formally, \( B \) is infinite if there exists a proper subset \( C \subset B \) such that \( C \) can be placed in one-to-one correspondence (bijection) with \( B \) itself.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Geometrically, infinite sets can be thought of as a continuum of points, such as all points on a line segment or the entire number line extending infinitely in both directions.

**Bold Text: Theorem 1: Characterization of Infinite Sets via Proper Subsets**

**Statement:**  

A set \( S \) is infinite if and only if there exists a proper subset \( T \subset S \) such that \( S \) and \( T \) are in one-to-one correspondence.

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Suppose \( S \) is infinite. Then it can be shown using the pigeonhole principle (or Cantor’s argument) that \( S \) has a proper subset \( T \subset S \) and a bijection \( f: S \to T \).

- **Step 2:** Conversely, if there exists a proper subset \( T \subset S \) such that \( S \cong T \) (bijection), then \( S \) cannot be finite because no finite set can be put into a bijection with its proper subset.

- **Step 3:** Hence, this property characterizes infinite sets.

### 1.4.3 Examples and Classification

**Examples of Finite Sets:**

1. \( A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \) with \( |A| = 4 \)  
2. \( B = \{x : x \text{ is a vowel in English alphabet}\} = \{a, e, i, o, u\} \), \( |B| = 5 \)  
3. The empty set \( \emptyset \), with \( |\emptyset| = 0 \)

**Examples of Infinite Sets:**

1. \( \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\} \), the set of natural numbers; clearly infinite.  
2. \( \mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \), the set of all integers; infinite as it extends in both directions.  
3. \( \mathbb{R} = \text{set of all real numbers} \), an uncountably infinite set.

---

**Formulas & Working Rule:**

- **Cardinality of finite set:**  
  \[
  |A| = n, \quad n \in \mathbb{N}_0
  \]

- **Definition of infinite set:**  
  \[
  \exists\, T \subset S, \quad T \neq S, \quad \text{and a bijection } f: S \to T.
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Identify Finite/Infinite Sets and Solve Problems:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify whether set elements can be explicitly listed (finite candidates).  
2. **Step 2:** Check if the number of elements is countable or uncountable.  
3. **Step 3:** For infinite candidate sets, verify if there is a proper subset with a bijection to the original set.  
4. **Step 4:** Use cardinality to classify finite sets by counting elements.  
5. **Step 5:** Use infinite set properties to solve problems, such as comparing infinite cardinalities or constructing bijections.

### 1.4.4 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Is the set \( A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} \) finite or infinite?

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** Explicitly count elements in \( A \).  
\[
A = \{2,4,6,8,10\} \implies |A| = 5
\]

**Step 2:** Since the cardinality is finite, \( A \) is a finite set.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Is the set \( B = \{x : x \text{ is an even natural number}\} \) finite or infinite?

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** List first elements:  
\[
2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots
\]

**Step 2:** The sequence continues indefinitely with no end.

**Step 3:** Establish a bijection with natural numbers \( \mathbb{N} \), e.g., \( f(n) = 2n \).

**Step 4:** Because this is a bijection to a proper subset, \( B \) is infinite.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Prove that the set of all multiples of 3, \( M = \{3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots\} \), is infinite by using the bijection method.

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** Define the function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to M \) by \( f(n) = 3n \).

**Step 2:** Show \( f \) is one-to-one:  
If \( f(m) = f(n) \), then \( 3m = 3n \implies m = n \).

**Step 3:** Show \( f \) is onto:  
For any \( y \in M \), \( y = 3k \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N} \), so \( y = f(k) \).

**Step 4:** Therefore, \( f \) is bijection, implying \( M \) is infinite as \( \mathbb{N} \) is infinite.

**Remarks:**  

Understanding the nature of finite and infinite sets, and the notion of cardinality, is crucial for more advanced studies in mathematics. Recognizing when a set is infinite by demonstrating bijections with proper subsets is a powerful tool. Practice constructing such correspondences for various infinite sets to master the concept.
