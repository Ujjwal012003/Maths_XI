### 1.3.1 Definition and Notation

**Introduction:**  

Among the most fundamental concepts in set theory is the **empty set**, a set that contains no elements. Despite having no members, the empty set plays a vital role in the structure of mathematics.

**Formal Definition:**  

A set which contains **no elements** is called an **empty set** or **null set**. It is denoted by the symbol  
\[
\emptyset
\]
or by a pair of braces with nothing inside:  
\[
\{\}
\]

For any set \( A \), the statement \( x \in \emptyset \) is always false, reflecting that no element belongs to the empty set.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Within the universal set \( U \), the empty set can be illustrated as a blank area with no points inside. On a Venn diagram, it is represented by an empty space or absence of any shaded region inside the universal set.

### 1.3.2 Properties of Empty Set

**Bold Text: Property 1: Uniqueness of the Empty Set**

**Statement:**  

There exists exactly one empty set.

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Suppose there are two empty sets, say \(\emptyset_1\) and \(\emptyset_2\).  
- **Step 2:** Since by definition, neither set contains any elements,  
  \[
  \forall x,\, x \notin \emptyset_1 \quad \text{and} \quad x \notin \emptyset_2.
  \]
- **Step 3:** Thus, both sets contain exactly the same elements (none).  
- **Step 4:** By the axiom of extensionality in set theory, two sets with exactly the same elements are equal.  

Therefore,  
\[
\emptyset_1 = \emptyset_2,
\]
implying uniqueness.

**Bold Text: Property 2: The Empty Set is a Subset of Every Set**

**Statement:**  

For any set \( A \),  
\[
\emptyset \subseteq A.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** By definition, \( B \subseteq A \) means every element of \( B \) is in \( A \).  
- **Step 2:** But the empty set has no elements.  
- **Step 3:** As there is no element in \(\emptyset\) to contradict the condition, the subset condition holds vacuously.  

Hence, the empty set is a subset of every set.

---

**Bold Text: Property 3: Intersection of any Set with Empty Set is Empty**

**Statement:**  

For any set \( A \),  
\[
A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** An element \( x \) belongs to \( A \cap \emptyset \) only if \( x \in A \) and \( x \in \emptyset \).  
- **Step 2:** But no element is in \(\emptyset\).  
- **Step 3:** Therefore, no element can belong to \( A \cap \emptyset \), so  
  \[
  A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset.
  \]

---

**Bold Text: Property 4: Union of any Set with Empty Set is the Set Itself**

**Statement:**  

For any set \( A \),  
\[
A \cup \emptyset = A.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** An element \( x \) belongs to \( A \cup \emptyset \) if \( x \in A \) or \( x \in \emptyset \).  
- **Step 2:** Since no element belongs to \(\emptyset\), this means  
  \[
  x \in A \cup \emptyset \iff x \in A.
  \]
- **Step 3:** Hence,  
  \[
  A \cup \emptyset = A.
  \]

---

### 1.3.3 Role in Set Theory

The empty set is indispensable in mathematics and set theory for the following reasons:

- **Identity Element in Union:** It acts as the identity element for the union operation, meaning adding \(\emptyset\) to any set does not change it.  
- **Absorbing Element in Intersection:** It absorbs every other set under intersection, resulting in \(\emptyset\).  
- **Base Case for Definitions:** In recursive definitions, the empty set is the base case, e.g., for sequences of sets.  
- **Functions and Relations:** It represents the domain or range when no inputs or outputs exist.  
- **Cardinality:** The size or cardinality of \(\emptyset\) is zero, denoted as  
  \[
  |\emptyset| = 0.
  \]
- **Foundation of Mathematical Logic:** The empty set underpins concepts in logic, including vacuous truth in proofs and statements.

### Formulas and Working Rule

- **Notation:**  
  \[
  \emptyset = \{\}
  \]

- **Subset property:**  
  \[
  \emptyset \subseteq A, \quad \forall A
  \]

- **Intersection:**  
  \[
  A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset
  \]

- **Union:**  
  \[
  A \cup \emptyset = A
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Approach Empty Set Problems:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify if the question involves sets containing zero elements.  
2. **Step 2:** Use the fact that \(\emptyset\) has no elements to evaluate subset, union, and intersection statements.  
3. **Step 3:** Apply vacuous truth for subset problems involving \(\emptyset\).  
4. **Step 4:** Utilize the unique properties of union and intersection with \(\emptyset\) to simplify expressions.  
5. **Step 5:** When needed, represent empty sets graphically as blank spaces within the universal set for visual understanding.  
6. **Step 6:** Confirm the cardinality of the empty set as zero when counting elements or comparing sizes.

### 1.3.4 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Is the empty set a subset of the set \( A = \{3, 5, 7\} \)?

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** Recall that the empty set has no elements.

**Step 2:** To be a subset, every element of \(\emptyset\) must be in \( A \).

**Step 3:** Since there are no elements in the empty set, there is no element to violate the condition.

**Conclusion:**  
\[
\emptyset \subseteq A.
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Find \( B \cap \emptyset \) where \( B = \{ x : x \text{ is a prime number less than } 10 \} \).

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** The set \( B = \{ 2, 3, 5, 7 \} \).

**Step 2:** Intersection with the empty set involves finding elements common to both.

**Step 3:** Since no element is in \(\emptyset\),  
\[
B \cap \emptyset = \emptyset.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) is the universal set, and \( A = \emptyset \), show that  
\[
A \subseteq B
\]
for every subset \( B \) of \( U \).

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** Recall the definition of subset: \( A \subseteq B \) means every element of \( A \) belongs to \( B \).

**Step 2:** Since \( A \) is empty with no elements, there is no element to contradict the subset condition.

**Step 3:** Therefore, \(\emptyset\) is a subset of every set \( B \) derived from \( U \).

---

**Remarks:**  

The empty set, though devoid of elements, is a foundational cornerstone of set theory and mathematics. Absorbing its properties and applying them correctly are essential for mastering more advanced topics. Always remember the vacuous truth principle when handling subsets involving the empty set.
