### 1.2.1 Roster or Tabular Form

**Introduction:**  

One of the simplest ways to represent a set is by listing all its elements explicitly. This method is called the **roster form** or **tabular form** of a set. It is straightforward and intuitive, especially useful for sets with a limited number of elements.

**Formal Definition:**  

In **roster form**, a set \( A \) is represented as a list of its elements enclosed in curly braces:  
\[
A = \{ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n \}
\]
where each \( a_i \) is an element of the set, and all elements are listed without repetition.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Visually, the set \( A \) can be pictured as a collection of discrete points on a diagram or number line corresponding to the listed elements.

### 1.2.2 Set-Builder Form

**Introduction:**  

When a set contains many elements or infinitely many elements, listing each element becomes impractical. Instead, such sets are often represented using **set-builder notation**, which defines the set by a property that all its elements share.

**Formal Definition:**  

A set \( B \) can be represented as:  
\[
B = \{ x : P(x) \}
\]
which reads as "set of all \( x \) such that property \( P(x) \) holds", where \( P(x) \) is a logical condition describing the elements of \( B \).

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Set-builder notation defines sets as regions or collections in space where elements satisfy the defining condition. For example, on the number line, the set of all real numbers greater than 2 can be represented as:  
\[
\{ x : x > 2 \}
\]
which corresponds to the ray starting at 2 and extending to infinity.

**Bold Text: Theorem 1: Uniqueness of Set Representation**

**Statement:**  

A set is completely determined by its elements, regardless of the form of representation.

Formally:  
\[
\text{If } A = \{ x : P(x) \} \text{ and } A = \{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{every } a_i \text{ satisfies } P(x) \text{ and no others do.}
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Given \( A \) defined by property \( P(x) \), every element in \( A \) must satisfy \( P(x) \) by definition.

- **Step 2:** If set \( A \), represented by roster form \( \{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \} \), contains only elements satisfying \( P(x) \), there can be no element outside this list in the set.

- **Step 3:** As both sets have the same elements, they are equal by the axiom of extensionality for sets.  

Hence, the representation of sets via roster or set-builder forms uniquely defines the same set if and only if the elements match.

**Formulas & Working Rule for Problems Involving Set Representations**

- **Roster Form:**  
  \[
  A = \{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \}
  \]

- **Set-Builder Form:**  
  \[
  B = \{ x : P(x) \}
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify whether elements can be easily listed (finite sets) or whether a defining property is more suitable (infinite or large sets).  
2. **Step 2:** For finite sets, write the elements separated by commas inside curly braces (Roster form).  
3. **Step 3:** For sets characterized by a property:  
   - Choose a variable (usually \( x \)) to represent elements.  
   - Write \( x : \) or \( x \mid \) meaning "such that".  
   - State the property \( P(x) \) defining the set.  
4. **Step 4:** Convert between forms when necessary:  
   - To move from roster to set-builder, identify a property all elements satisfy.  
   - To move from set-builder to roster, list all elements satisfying \( P(x) \) if the set is finite.  
5. **Step 5:** Use Venn diagrams or number lines to visualize sets aiding in understanding.

### 1.2.3 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Represent the set of vowels in English alphabet in roster form and set-builder form.

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** List vowels explicitly.  
\[
V = \{ a, e, i, o, u \}
\]

**Step 2:** Express using a property.  
\[
V = \{ x : x \text{ is a vowel in English alphabet} \}
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Write the set of even natural numbers less than 20 in roster and set-builder forms.

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** List even natural numbers less than 20 (from 2 to 18):  
\[
E = \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 \}
\]

**Step 2:** Write in set-builder form:  
\[
E = \{ x : x \text{ is a natural number}, x \text{ is even and } x < 20 \}
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Represent the set of integers \( x \) such that \( -3 \leq x < 3 \) in both forms.

**Solution:**  

**Step 1:** List elements satisfying \( -3 \leq x < 3 \) with \( x \) integer:  
\[
S = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \}
\]

**Step 2:** Write the set-builder form:  
\[
S = \{ x : x \in \mathbb{Z}, -3 \leq x < 3 \}
\]

**Remarks:**  

Mastering both roster and set-builder representations of sets improves clarity in mathematical communication and problem-solving ability. When dealing with infinite or large sets, set-builder notation is especially valuable to avoid lengthy listings. Conversely, finite well-defined sets are easier to grasp with the roster form.

Understanding these representations is a cornerstone for learning more advanced set operations, functions, and relations.
