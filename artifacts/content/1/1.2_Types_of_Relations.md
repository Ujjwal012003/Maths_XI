Relations on sets form the basic building block in understanding connections between elements. Each relation possesses specific properties that characterize their structure and behavior. In this section, we explore common types of relations: empty, universal, reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and equivalence relations, along with their formal definitions, geometric meanings, theorems, proofs, and examples.

### 1.2.1 Empty Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Empty relation visualization: no pairs connected" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.1:</b> Graphical representation of an empty relation with no connections</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

A **relation** \( R \) on a set \( A \) is called the **empty relation** if it contains no ordered pairs from \( A \times A \). In other words,

\[
\boxed{
R = \emptyset \subseteq A \times A
}
\]

This means no element of \( A \) is related to any element of \( A \) under \( R \).

#### Geometric Meaning

- The empty relation is represented by a graph on the set \( A \) with **no edges** or arrows between any vertices.
- Geometrically, it looks like isolated points without any connection.

#### Theorem 

**Theorem 1:** The empty relation on a set \( A \) is a subset of every relation on \( A \).

\[
\boxed{
\forall R \subseteq A \times A, \quad \emptyset \subseteq R
}
\]

##### Proof:

- By definition of set inclusion, \( X \subseteq Y \) if every element of \( X \) is an element of \( Y \).
- Since the empty set \( \emptyset \) has *no* elements, there are no elements to contradict this property.
- Therefore, \( \emptyset \subseteq R \) holds for any relation \( R \subseteq A \times A \).

\(\Rightarrow\) This completes the proof.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Formulas:**

\[
R = \emptyset, \quad R \subseteq A \times A, \quad |R| = 0
\]

The empty relation has zero ordered pairs.

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Identify if a Relation is Empty:**

1. Check the given relation \( R \).
2. If no ordered pairs \( (a, b) \in R \), then \( R = \emptyset \) (Empty Relation).
3. Otherwise, \( R \) is not empty.

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \). Consider the relation

\[
R = \emptyset.
\]

Show that \( R \) is an empty relation.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: By the definition, since \( R \) has zero elements, \( R = \emptyset \).
- Step 2: Hence, \( R \) is empty.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \{a, b\} \) and \( R = \{(a, a), (b, a)\} \). Is \( R \) an empty relation?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Since \( R \) has two ordered pairs, it is not empty.
- Step 2: Therefore, \( R \neq \emptyset \).

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Suppose \( A = \mathbb{N} \) and consider the relation

\[
R = \{ (m, n) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} : m > n \text{ and } m < n \}.
\]

Is \( R \) empty?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: The condition requires \( m > n \) and \( m < n \) simultaneously.
- Step 2: This is impossible for any \( m,n \in \mathbb{N} \).
- Step 3: Hence, \( R = \emptyset \).

---

### 1.2.2 Universal Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Universal relation full graph with all pairs connected" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.2:</b> Graph of universal relation showing all possible pairs connected</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

The **universal relation** on a set \( A \) is the relation that relates **every possible ordered pair** in \( A \times A \). Formally,

\[
\boxed{
R = A \times A
}
\]

It contains **all** ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) where \( a, b \in A \).

#### Geometric Meaning

- The universal relation corresponds to a **complete graph** on the set \( A \).
- Every vertex is connected to every other vertex (including itself).
- Graphically, this is a fully connected diagram with loops at all nodes.

#### Theorem

**Theorem 2:** The universal relation on \( A \) is the largest relation on \( A \).

\[
\boxed{
\forall R \subseteq A \times A, \quad R \subseteq A \times A
}
\]

##### Proof:

- The universal relation contains **all** possible ordered pairs.
- By the definition of set inclusion, any relation \( R \subseteq A \times A \) is a subset of \( A \times A \).
- Thus, the universal relation is maximal amongst relations on \( A \).

\(\Rightarrow\) This completes the proof.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Formulas:**

\[
|A \times A| = |A|^2, \quad |R| = |A|^2 \quad \text{if } R = A \times A
\]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Identify a Universal Relation:**

1. Given a relation \( R \) on \( A \), count the number of ordered pairs.
2. If \( |R| = |A|^2 \) and includes all pairs \( (a, b) \), then \( R \) is universal.
3. Verify that no pair is missing.

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

For \( A = \{x, y\} \), find the universal relation.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Find \( A \times A \):

  \[
  \{(x,x), (x,y), (y,x), (y,y)\}
  \]

- Step 2: The universal relation is precisely this set.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \) and relation 

\[
R = \{(1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,1), (2,1), (3,3), (1,3), (2,2), (3,2)\}.
\]

Is \( R \) universal?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( |A|=3 \), hence \( |A \times A|=9 \).
- Step 2: Count \( |R|=9 \).
- Step 3: Check if all ordered pairs are present.
- Step 4: Since all pairs are present, \( R \) is universal.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Let \( A = \{a,b,c\} \). Consider relation 

\[
R = \{ (a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (a,b), (b,c), (c,a), (b,a), (c,b), (a,c) \}.
\]

(a) Show \( R \) is universal.

(b) What happens if one pair is removed?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( |R| = 9 = 3^2 \), so \( R = A \times A \).
- Step 2: Therefore, \( R \) is universal.
- Step 3: If a pair, say \( (a,b) \), is removed, then \( R \neq A \times A \).
- Step 4: The relation will no longer be universal.

### 1.2.3 Reflexive Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph showing reflexive relation with loops on each vertex" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.3:</b> Reflexive relation with loops indicating each element relates to itself</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

A relation \( R \) on a non-empty set \( A \) is **reflexive** if every element of \( A \) is related to itself, i.e.,

\[
\boxed{
\forall a \in A, \quad (a, a) \in R
}
\]

#### Geometric Meaning

- The graph of a reflexive relation has a **loop** (edge from a vertex to itself) at every vertex.
- These loops indicate self-relatedness.

#### Theorem

**Theorem 3:** The reflexive closure of a relation \( R \) on \( A \) is 

\[
\boxed{
\text{Reflexive Closure}(R) = R \cup \{(a,a) : a \in A\}
}
\]

##### Proof:

- By adding all missing loops \( (a,a) \) for each \( a \in A \), we get a reflexive relation containing \( R \).
- This closure is the smallest reflexive relation containing \( R \), since any reflexive relation must contain all loops.

\(\Rightarrow\) This completes the proof.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Formulas:**

\[
R \text{ is reflexive} \iff \{(a,a) : a \in A\} \subseteq R
\]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Check Reflexivity:**

1. For each \( a \in A \), check if \( (a,a) \in R \).
2. If true for all \( a \), relation is reflexive.
3. Otherwise, it is not reflexive.

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \) and 

\[
R = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2)\}.
\]

Is \( R \) reflexive?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Check if \( (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) \in R \).
- Step 2: Since all loops are present, \( R \) is reflexive.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \{a,b\} \), \( R = \{(a,a), (b,a)\} \).

Is \( R \) reflexive?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Check \( (a,a) \in R \) — yes.
- Step 2: Check \( (b,b) \in R \) — no.
- Step 3: Hence, \( R \) is not reflexive.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Given \( A = \{x,y,z\} \) and relation

\[
R = \{(x,x), (y,y), (z,z), (x,y), (y,z), (x,z)\}.
\]

(a) Is \( R \) reflexive?

(b) Find its reflexive closure.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Loops at \( x,y,z \) are present, so \( R \) is reflexive.
- Step 2: Reflexive closure of \( R \) is \( R \) itself.

### 1.2.4 Symmetric Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph illustrating symmetric relation with paired edges" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.4:</b> Symmetric relation with edges showing bidirectional relation between vertices</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

A relation \( R \) on a set \( A \) is **symmetric** if

\[
\boxed{
\forall a,b \in A, \quad (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R
}
\]

#### Geometric Meaning

- The graph of a symmetric relation has edges that appear in pairs between vertices.
- If there is an edge from \( a \) to \( b \), there is a corresponding edge from \( b \) to \( a \).
- Loops are symmetric trivially because \( (a,a) = (a,a) \).

#### Theorem

**Theorem 4:** The symmetric closure of \( R \) is

\[
\boxed{
R \cup R^{-1}, \quad \text{where } R^{-1} = \{(b,a) : (a,b) \in R\}
}
\]

##### Proof:

- Adding the converse of each ordered pair in \( R \) ensures that if \( (a,b) \in R \), then \( (b,a) \in R \).
- This closure is the smallest symmetric superset of \( R \).

\(\Rightarrow\) This completes the proof.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Formulas:**

\[
R \text{ is symmetric} \iff R = R^{-1}
\]

where

\[
R^{-1} = \{(b,a) : (a,b) \in R\}.
\]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Check Symmetry:**

1. For every ordered pair \( (a,b) \in R \), check if \( (b,a) \in R \).
2. If true for all pairs, then \( R \) is symmetric.
3. Otherwise, it is not symmetric.

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \{1,2\} \), \( R = \{(1,2), (2,1), (1,1)\} \).

Is \( R \) symmetric?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( (1,2) \in R \) and its reverse \( (2,1) \in R \).
- Step 2: \( (1,1) \) is a loop, symmetric by definition.
- Step 3: Hence, \( R \) is symmetric.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \{a,b\} \), \( R = \{(a,b), (b,b)\} \).

Is \( R \) symmetric?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( (a,b) \in R \), check for \( (b,a) \in R \) — not present.
- Step 2: Thus, \( R \) is not symmetric.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Given \( A = \{x,y,z\} \) and 

\[
R = \{(x,y), (y,x), (y,z), (z,y), (x,x)\}.
\]

(a) Is \( R \) symmetric?

(b) Find symmetric closure if not.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Each pair has its converse present.
- Step 2: \( R \) is symmetric.
- Step 3: Symmetric closure is \( R \) itself.

---

### 1.2.5 Transitive Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph showing transitive relation with path connection" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.5:</b> Transitive relation graph showing indirect connections imply direct connections</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

A relation \( R \) on \( A \) is **transitive** if

\[
\boxed{
\forall a,b,c \in A, \quad (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R
}
\]

#### Geometric Meaning

- If there is a path from vertex \( a \) to \( b \) and from \( b \) to \( c \), then the transitive property requires a direct edge from \( a \) to \( c \).
- This effectively "closes" triangles in the directed graph.

#### Theorem

**Theorem 5:** The transitive closure of \( R \) is the smallest transitive relation containing \( R \).

It can be constructed by adding all pairs \( (a,c) \) whenever \( (a,b), (b,c) \in R \), repeating until no new pairs can be added.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Check Transitivity:**

1. For every \( (a,b), (b,c) \in R \), verify if \( (a,c) \in R \).
2. If true for all such pairs, \( R \) is transitive.
3. Otherwise, \( R \) is not transitive.

**Algorithm to Find Transitive Closure:**

1. Initialize \( R' = R \).
2. For every \( (a,b), (b,c) \in R' \), if \( (a,c) \notin R' \), add \( (a,c) \) to \( R' \).
3. Repeat step 2 until no new pairs are added.
4. \( R' \) is the transitive closure of \( R \).

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \), \( R = \{(1,2), (2,3), (1,3)\} \).

Is \( R \) transitive?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( (1,2), (2,3) \in R \).
- Step 2: \( (1,3) \in R \).
- Step 3: No other relevant pairs violate transitivity.
- Step 4: Hence, \( R \) is transitive.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \{a,b,c\} \),

\[
R = \{(a,b), (b,c)\}.
\]

Is \( R \) transitive?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: \( (a,b), (b,c) \in R \).
- Step 2: Check if \( (a,c) \in R \).
- Step 3: \( (a,c) \notin R \).
- Step 4: Hence, \( R \) is not transitive.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Let \( A = \{x,y,z\} \) and

\[
R = \{(x,y), (y,z), (x,z), (z,x)\}.
\]

(a) Is \( R \) transitive?

(b) If not, find the transitive closure.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Check pairs:
  
  - \( (x,y), (y,z) \implies (x,z) \in R \) (true).
  - \( (y,z), (z,x) \implies (y,x) \in R \)? No.

- Step 2: \( (y,x) \notin R \) violates transitivity.

- Step 3: Add \( (y,x) \) to obtain closure.

- Step 4: Repeat checks until closure is transitive.

### 1.2.6 Equivalence Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Graph of equivalence relation partitioning set into equivalence classes" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.2.6:</b> Equivalence relation partitions set into disjoint equivalence classes</i></figcaption>
</figure>

#### Definition

A relation \( R \) on a set \( A \) is an **equivalence relation** if it is

- **Reflexive:** \( \forall a \in A, (a,a) \in R \).
- **Symmetric:** \( (a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \in R \).
- **Transitive:** \( (a,b) \in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in R \implies (a,c) \in R \).

Formally,

\[
\boxed{
R \text{ is an equivalence relation } \iff R \text{ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.}
}
\]

#### Geometric Meaning

- The set \( A \) is partitioned into **equivalence classes**.
- Each equivalence class forms a subset of elements mutually related by \( R \).
- Graphically, vertices split into disconnected complete subgraphs.

#### Theorem

**Theorem 6:** Every equivalence relation partitions the set \( A \) into disjoint equivalence classes.

##### Proof (Outline):

- Define the equivalence class for \( a \in A \) as

  \[
  [a] = \{x \in A : (a,x) \in R\}.
  \]

- Since \( R \) is reflexive, \( a \in [a] \) ensuring non-empty classes.
- Symmetry and transitivity imply that for any \( a, b \in A \), either \( [a] = [b] \) or \( [a] \cap [b] = \emptyset \).
- Thus, the collection \( \{ [a] : a \in A \} \) forms a partition of \( A \).

\(\Rightarrow\) This completes the proof.

#### Formulas and Working Rule

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Check Equivalence Relation:**

1. Check if \( R \) is reflexive.
2. Check if \( R \) is symmetric.
3. Check if \( R \) is transitive.
4. If all hold, then \( R \) is an equivalence relation.
5. Optionally, determine equivalence classes \( [a] \) for each \( a \in A \).

#### Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \). Define 

\[
R = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)\}.
\]

Is \( R \) an equivalence relation?

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Reflexivity: All \( (a,a) \) present.
- Step 2: Symmetry: \( (1,2) \in R \implies (2,1) \in R \).
- Step 3: Transitivity: 
  - \( (1,2), (2,1) \implies (1,1) \in R \).
- Step 4: All conditions hold; thus, \( R \) is an equivalence relation.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let 

\[
A = \{a,b,c\}, \quad R = \{(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (a,b), (b,a), (b,c), (c,b)\}.
\]

Is \( R \) an equivalence relation?

**Solution:**

- Reflexive? Yes.
- Symmetric? \( (a,b) \) and \( (b,a) \), \( (b,c) \) and \( (c,b) \) all present; yes.
- Transitive? Check \( (a,b), (b,c) \implies (a,c) \) in \( R \)? \( (a,c) \notin R \).
- Since transitivity fails, \( R \) is **not** an equivalence relation.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Given integers \( \mathbb{Z} \), define the relation \( R \) by

\[
a R b \iff a \equiv b \pmod{n}.
\]

(a) Show \( R \) is an equivalence relation.

(b) Describe partitions created.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Reflexive: \( a \equiv a \pmod{n} \) for all \( a \).
- Step 2: Symmetric: If \( a \equiv b \pmod{n} \), then \( b \equiv a \pmod{n} \).
- Step 3: Transitive: If \( a \equiv b \pmod{n} \) and \( b \equiv c \pmod{n} \), then \( a \equiv c \pmod{n} \).
- Step 4: Thus, \( R \) is an equivalence relation.
- Step 5: The relation partitions \( \mathbb{Z} \) into residue classes modulo \( n \).
