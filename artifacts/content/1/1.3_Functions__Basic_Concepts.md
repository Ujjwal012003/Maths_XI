**Introduction:**  
A function is a fundamental mathematical concept describing a precise correspondence between elements of two sets. Intuitively, a function assigns an output to each input in a way that is consistently defined.

**Formal Definition:**  
A **function** \( f \) from a set \( X \) (called the **domain**) to a set \( Y \) (called the **codomain**) is a relation that assigns to every element \( x \in X \) exactly one element \( y \in Y \). We denote this relation by
\[
f: X \to Y, \quad \text{where} \quad y = f(x).
\]
This means for each \( x \in X \), there exists a uniquely determined element \( y \in Y \) called the image of \( x \) under \( f \).

**Key Condition:**
- For a function, **each input has exactly one output**.
- Multiple inputs can have the same output.

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Geometrically, if \( X \) and \( Y \) are subsets of the real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \), a function \( f \) can be represented as a graph in the Cartesian plane. The graph is the set of points \( (x, f(x)) \) for all \( x \in X \).

A crucial visual criterion for \( f \) to be a function when represented graphically is:
- The **Vertical Line Test**: No vertical line intersects the graph of \( f \) at more than one point. This ensures that each input \( x \) corresponds to only one output \( f(x) \).

</figure>

**Introduction:**  
To talk about functions rigorously, we need to identify the sets involved — the input set, output possibilities, and actual outputs.

**Definitions:**

- **Domain**: The set of all possible inputs \( x \) for which a function \( f \) is defined. It is the set \( X \) in the declaration \( f: X \to Y \).

- **Codomain**: The set \( Y \) into which all outputs of the function are constrained. It represents the possible set of outputs as allowed by the function's definition.

- **Range (Image)**: The actual subset of the codomain consisting of all outputs \( f(x) \) where \( x \in X \). Formally,
\[
\text{Range}(f) = \{ y \in Y : y = f(x) \text{ for some } x \in X \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**

- The **domain** corresponds to values along the \( x \)-axis for which points lie on the graph.
- The **codomain** is the entire set \( Y \), often visualized as the possible values along the \( y \)-axis.
- The **range** corresponds to those actual \( y \)-values achieved by \( f \), seen as the vertical spread of the graph points.

### Theorems & Proofs

**Theorem 1 (Function Well-definedness):**  
\[
\boxed{
\text{If } f : A \to B \text{ is a function, then for every } x \in A, \text{ there exists a unique } y \in B \text{ such that } f(x) = y.
}
\]

**Proof:**  
- **Step 1:** Let \( x \in A \) be arbitrary.  
- **Step 2:** By definition of a function, there exists at least one \( y \in B \) such that \( f(x) = y \).  
- **Step 3:** Suppose, for contradiction, there exist two distinct outputs \( y_1 \neq y_2 \) such that \( f(x) = y_1 \) and \( f(x) = y_2 \).  
- **Step 4:** This contradicts the uniqueness condition in the definition of a function.  
- **Step 5:** Hence, for each \( x \), exactly one \( y \) corresponds to it.

---

**Theorem 2 (Injective Functions):**  
\[
\boxed{
f: A \to B \text{ is injective (one-to-one) if and only if } f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2.
}
\]

**Proof:**  
- **Step 1:** Assume \( f \) is injective.  
- **Step 2:** Take any \( x_1, x_2 \in A \) such that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \).  
- **Step 3:** By injectivity definition, this implies \( x_1 = x_2 \).  
- **Step 4:** Conversely, if for all \( x_1, x_2 \), \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \implies x_1 = x_2 \), then no two distinct inputs map to the same output, which means \( f \) is injective.

---

**Theorem 3 (Surjective Functions):**  
\[
\boxed{
f: A \to B \text{ is surjective (onto) if and only if } \forall y \in B, \exists x \in A \text{ such that } f(x) = y.
}
\]

**Proof:**  
- **Step 1:** Assume \( f \) is surjective.  
- **Step 2:** By definition, for every \( y \in B \), there exists \( x \in A \) such that \( f(x) = y \).  
- **Step 3:** Conversely, if for every \( y \in B \), such an \( x \) can be found, then the range of \( f \) equals \( B \), and \( f \) is surjective.  
- **Step 4:** If there exists any \( y \in B \) for which no such \( x \) exists, \( f \) is not surjective.

---

### Formulas & Working Rule

**Standard Notations:**
- \( f: X \to Y \implies X \) is the Domain, \( Y \) is the Codomain.
- \( \text{Range}(f) = \{ f(x) : x \in X \} \subseteq Y \).

**Summary of concepts:**  
\[
\begin{cases}
\text{Domain} = X, \text{ inputs for which } f \text{ is defined}, \\
\text{Codomain} = Y, \text{ proposed outputs}, \\
\text{Range} = \{ y \in Y : y = f(x), x \in X \}, \text{ actual outputs}.
\end{cases}
\]

---

**Working Rule to Analyze a Function:**

1. **Identify the domain \( X \)** by determining all permissible input values (e.g., avoid denominators zero, radicals of negative numbers, logarithms of non-positive numbers).
2. **Identify the codomain \( Y \)** as given or infer based on the problem context.
3. **Find the range** by evaluating \( f(x) \) over \( x \in X \), potentially using:
   - Algebraic manipulations,
   - Inequality considerations,
   - Graph sketches or analysis.
4. **Test if the function is one-one (injective) or onto (surjective)** as required, using definitions.
5. **Interpret the graph** to understand domain, codomain, and range visually.

### Graded Solved Examples

#### Example 1 (Concept Building - Basic)  
**Problem:** Determine the domain and range of the function
\[
f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2}.
\]

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Domain: Since the radicand must be non-negative,
\[
4 - x^2 \geq 0 \implies x^2 \leq 4 \implies -2 \leq x \leq 2.
\]
Thus, the domain is \( D = [-2, 2] \).

- **Step 2:** Range: Because \( f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2} \), values are non-negative.

The maximum value of \( f \) occurs at \( x = 0 \):
\[
f(0) = \sqrt{4} = 2,
\]
and the minimum value at \( x = \pm 2 \):
\[
f(\pm 2) = \sqrt{4 - 4} = 0.
\]
Hence, range \( R = [0, 2] \).

- **Step 3:** If codomain not specified, it is usually taken as \( \mathbb{R} \).

**Answer:**  
Domain: \( [-2, 2] \), Range: \( [0, 2] \).

---

#### Example 2 (Competency Based – Intermediate)  
**Problem:** If \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is defined by
\[
f(x) = \frac{2x + 3}{x - 1},
\]
find the domain, codomain, and range.

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Domain: The denominator cannot be zero,
\[
x - 1 \neq 0 \implies x \neq 1.
\]
So, domain is \( D = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\} \).

- **Step 2:** Codomain is as given, \( \mathbb{R} \).

- **Step 3:** Find range:

Let
\[
y = \frac{2x + 3}{x - 1}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
y(x - 1) = 2x + 3 \implies yx - y = 2x + 3,
\]
\[
yx - 2x = y + 3 \implies x(y - 2) = y + 3.
\]

- If \( y \neq 2 \),
\[
x = \frac{y + 3}{y - 2}.
\]

- **Step 4:** Since \( x \neq 1 \), check for \( y \) such that \( x = 1 \):
\[
x = 1 \implies 1 = \frac{y + 3}{y - 2} \implies y + 3 = y - 2,
\]
which simplifies to
\[
3 = -2,
\]
an impossibility.

- **Step 5:** Check specifically for \( y=2 \):
\[
y=2 = \frac{2x + 3}{x -1} \implies 2(x -1) = 2x + 3 \implies 2x - 2 = 2x + 3,
\]
impossible; thus \( y=2 \) is not in the range.

- **Step 6:** Therefore,
\[
\text{Range} = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{2\}.
\]

**Answer:**
- Domain: \( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\} \),
- Codomain: \( \mathbb{R} \),
- Range: \( \mathbb{R} \setminus \{2\} \).

---

#### Example 3 (HOTS - Higher Order Thinking Skills)  
**Problem:**  
Consider the function
\[
f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}, \quad f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+1}.
\]
Determine if \( f \) is one-one and onto. Also find its domain, codomain, and range.

**Solution:**

- **Step 1:** Domain is given as \( [0, \infty) \).

- **Step 2:** Codomain is given as \( \mathbb{R} \).

- **Step 3:** Check whether \( f \) is one-one.

Suppose \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \):
\[
\frac{x_1 - 1}{x_1 + 1} = \frac{x_2 - 1}{x_2 + 1}.
\]

Cross-multiplied:
\[
(x_1 - 1)(x_2 + 1) = (x_2 - 1)(x_1 + 1).
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
x_1 x_2 + x_1 - x_2 - 1 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 - x_1 - 1.
\]

Cancel the common terms \( x_1 x_2 \) and \( -1 \):
\[
x_1 + x_1 x_2 - x_2 - 1 = x_1 x_2 + x_2 - x_1 -1 \implies x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_1.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
x_1 - x_2 = x_2 - x_1 \implies 2x_1 = 2x_2 \implies x_1 = x_2.
\]

Thus, \( f \) is one-one on \( [0, \infty) \).

- **Step 4:** Find the range.

Set
\[
y = \frac{x - 1}{x + 1}.
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
y(x + 1) = x - 1 \implies yx + y = x -1,
\]
\[
yx - x = -1 - y,
\]
\[
x(y - 1) = - (1 + y),
\]
\[
x = \frac{-(1 + y)}{y - 1} = \frac{1 + y}{1 - y}.
\]

- **Step 5:** Since \( x \geq 0 \), impose:
\[
\frac{1 + y}{1 - y} \geq 0.
\]

- **Step 6:** Analyze sign of numerator and denominator:

- Numerator \( 1 + y \geq 0 \implies y \geq -1 \).
- Denominator \( 1 - y > 0 \implies y < 1 \) (denominator cannot be zero).

For the fraction to be nonnegative, numerator and denominator must have the same sign.

- Case 1 (Both positive):
\[
y \geq -1 \quad \text{and} \quad y < 1 \implies y \in [-1,1).
\]

- Case 2 (Both negative):
\[
1 + y < 0 \implies y < -1,
\]
and
\[
1 - y < 0 \implies y > 1,
\]
which is impossible simultaneously.

- **Step 7:** Therefore,
\[
\text{Range} = [-1, 1).
\]

- **Step 8:** Check if \( f \) is onto \( \mathbb{R} \):

Since \( \text{Range} \neq \mathbb{R} \), \( f \) is not onto.

---

**Answer:**

- Domain: \( [0, \infty) \),
- Codomain: \( \mathbb{R} \),
- Range: \( [-1, 1) \),
- The function \( f \) is **one-one** but **not onto**.
