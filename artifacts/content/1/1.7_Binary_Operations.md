**Introduction:**

In mathematics, we often combine two elements from a set to produce a third element. This process of combining two elements in a specific manner is called a **binary operation**. It generalizes many familiar operations like addition and multiplication on numbers.

**Definition:**

Let \( A \) be a non-empty set. A **binary operation** on \( A \) is a function
\[
* : A \times A \to A
\]
which assigns to each ordered pair \((a, b) \in A \times A\) a unique element \(a * b \in A\).

Here, \( A \times A \) is the Cartesian product of \( A \) with itself, i.e., the set of all ordered pairs with both elements from \( A \).

**Geometric Meaning:**

Geometrically, the domain of the binary operation can be represented as points on the plane \( A \times A \), and the operation maps each point \((a,b)\) to a point \(a * b\) in \( A \). If \( A \) is a subset of real numbers, then \( A \times A \) can be viewed as the \( xy \)-plane, and the operation corresponds to a function that assigns a number to each point on this plane.

For example, the addition operation \( + : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) assigns the sum \( x + y \) to each point \((x, y)\). Visually, the function \( f(x,y) = x + y \) represents a surface in 3D—a plane over the 2D domain.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.7.3:</b> Visualization of key properties: closure, associativity, and identity</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Binary operations on a set can have several important properties:

---

**1. Closure:**

A binary operation \( * \) on a set \( A \) is said to be **closed** if for every \( a, b \in A \), the result \( a * b \) is also in \( A \):
\[
\boxed{
\text{Closure: } \forall a,b \in A, \quad a * b \in A
}
\]
This property ensures the operation stays within the set.

---

**2. Associativity:**

The binary operation \( * \) on \( A \) is **associative** if for all \( a,b,c \in A \),
\[
\boxed{
(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
}
\]
This means grouping the operations does not affect the result.

---

**3. Commutativity:**

The operation \( * \) on \( A \) is **commutative** if for all \( a,b \in A \),
\[
\boxed{
a * b = b * a
}
\]
Order of operation does not affect the output.

---

**4. Identity Element:**

An element \( e \in A \) is called an **identity element** with respect to \( * \) if for all \( a \in A \),
\[
\boxed{
e * a = a * e = a
}
\]
The identity leaves every element unchanged under the operation.

---

**5. Inverse Element:**

Given an identity element \( e \) in \( A \), an element \( a \in A \) is said to have an **inverse** \( a^{-1} \in A \) if
\[
\boxed{
a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e
}
\]
The inverse "undoes" the operation.

---

**Theorems and Proofs**

---

**Theorem 1 (Closure of Real Number Addition):**  

*Addition of real numbers is closed.*  
\[
\boxed{
\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}, \quad x + y \in \mathbb{R}
}
\]

**Proof:**

**Step 1:** Let \( x,y \in \mathbb{R} \) be any two real numbers.

**Step 2:** By the definition of real numbers and their operations, addition \( x + y \) is defined and the result is a real number.

**Step 3:** Hence, \( x + y \in \mathbb{R} \).

\(\therefore\) Addition on \( \mathbb{R} \) is closed.

---

**Theorem 2 (Associativity of Real Number Multiplication):**

\[
\boxed{
(x y) z = x (y z), \quad \forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}
}
\]

**Proof:**

**Step 1:** Consider arbitrary \( x,y,z \in \mathbb{R} \).

**Step 2:** The multiplication of real numbers satisfies associativity by the field axioms; that is:
\[
(x y) z = x (y z)
\]

**Step 3:** This is a standard and fundamental property of multiplication in \( \mathbb{R} \).

\(\therefore\) Multiplication on \( \mathbb{R} \) is associative.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.7.4:</b> Algorithmic approach to handling binary operations on sets</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Formulas:**

For a binary operation \( * \) on \( A \):

1. Closure:
\[
a * b \in A, \quad \forall a,b \in A
\]

2. Associativity:
\[
(a * b) * c = a * (b * c), \quad \forall a,b,c \in A
\]

3. Identity \( e \):
\[
e * a = a * e = a, \quad \forall a \in A
\]

4. Inverse \( a^{-1} \) (if exists):
\[
a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e
\]

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for Applying a Binary Operation:**

1. Identify the **set \( A \)** on which the binary operation \( * \) is defined.

2. Understand the **operation \( * \)**. It takes two inputs from \( A \) and produces an output in \( A \).

3. Check if the operation is **closed**: For each pair \( (a,b) \), confirm that \( a * b \in A \).

4. Verify other properties as needed:
   - **Associativity:** Check if \( (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) \) for arbitrary \( a,b,c \in A \).
   - **Commutativity:** Check if \( a*b = b*a \).
   - **Identity Element:** Find \( e \in A \) such that \( e*a = a*e = a \).
   - **Inverse:** For each \( a \), find \( a^{-1} \) such that \( a*a^{-1} = e \).

5. Use the operation on specific elements \( (a,b) \) by substituting and simplifying as per the definition.

6. For problem-solving, explicitly write each step: input values, apply operation, check results.

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.7.5:</b> Stepwise problem solving approach for binary operations</i></figcaption>
</figure>

---

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**

Let \( A = \mathbb{R} \) and define \( * \) by
\[
a * b = a + b + 1.
\]
Show that \( * \) is a binary operation on \( A \).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Given \( a,b \in \mathbb{R} \).

**Step 2:** Compute \( a * b = a + b + 1 \).

**Step 3:** Since \( a, b, \) and \( 1 \) are real numbers, their sum is also a real number.

**Step 4:** Therefore,
\[
a * b \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{for all } a,b \in \mathbb{R}.
\]

\(\Rightarrow\) \( * \) is a binary operation on \( \mathbb{R} \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**

Let \( A = \mathbb{Z} \) (integers). Define \( * \) by
\[
a * b = 3a - 2b.
\]
Verify whether \( * \) is associative on \( A \).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Take arbitrary \( a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z} \).

**Step 2:** Compute \((a*b)*c\):
\[
a * b = 3a - 2b,
\]
so
\[
(a*b)*c = (3a - 2b)*c = 3(3a - 2b) - 2c = 9a - 6b - 2c.
\]

**Step 3:** Compute \( a*(b*c) \):
\[
b * c = 3b - 2c,
\]
so
\[
a*(b*c) = a*(3b - 2c) = 3a - 2(3b - 2c) = 3a - 6b + 4c.
\]

**Step 4:** Compare:
\[
(a*b)*c = 9a - 6b - 2c,
\]
\[
a*(b*c) = 3a - 6b + 4c.
\]

Equality requires:
\[
9a - 6b - 2c = 3a - 6b + 4c \implies 6a = 6c \implies a = c.
\]

**Step 5:** Since the condition \( a = c \) does not hold for all \( a,c \in \mathbb{Z} \), the operation \( * \) is **not associative** on \( \mathbb{Z} \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**

Let \( A = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \). Define \( * \) by
\[
a * b = \frac{ab}{2}.
\]

(a) Show \( * \) is a binary operation on \( A \).

(b) Find the identity element for \( * \).

(c) For \( a \in A \), find the inverse of \( a \) under \( * \).

**Solution:**

---

**(a) Closure:**

**Step 1:** Take \( a,b \in A \), so \( a,b \neq 0 \).

**Step 2:** Compute
\[
a * b = \frac{ab}{2}.
\]

**Step 3:** The product \( ab \neq 0 \), because \( a,b \neq 0 \). Division by 2 (nonzero) is defined.

**Step 4:** Thus, \( a * b \neq 0 \); hence \( a * b \in A \).

\(\Rightarrow\) \( * \) is a binary operation on \( A \).

---

**(b) Identity element:**

**Step 1:** Suppose \( e \in A \) is the identity element such that for all \( a \in A \),
\[
a * e = \frac{a e}{2} = a.
\]

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
a e = 2 a.
\]

**Step 3:** Since \( a \neq 0 \), divide both sides by \( a \):
\[
e = 2.
\]

**Step 4:** Verify identity on the other side:
\[
e * a = \frac{e a}{2} = \frac{2a}{2} = a.
\]

So, \( e = 2 \) is the identity element.

---

**(c) Inverse element:**

**Step 1:** For \( a \in A \), find \( a^{-1} \in A \) such that
\[
a * a^{-1} = e = 2.
\]

**Step 2:** By definition,
\[
\frac{a \times a^{-1}}{2} = 2.
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
a \times a^{-1} = 4.
\]

**Step 3:** Divide both sides by \( a \neq 0 \):
\[
a^{-1} = \frac{4}{a}.
\]

Since \( a \neq 0 \), \( a^{-1} \in A \).

Hence, the inverse of \( a \) is \( \frac{4}{a} \).

---

**Summary:**

- \( * \) is a binary operation on \( A = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \).

- Identity element is \( e = 2 \).

- Inverse of \( a \in A \) is \( a^{-1} = \frac{4}{a} \).

---

This completes the comprehensive study of binary operations on sets, their properties, and applications on real numbers.
