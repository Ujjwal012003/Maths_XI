### 1.11.1 Introduction

**Relations** and **Functions** are fundamental concepts that establish associations between elements of two sets. In everyday life and various scientific fields, these concepts enable us to understand and model correspondences — such as assigning each student their score, linking computer inputs to outputs, or interpreting physical quantities via graphs. Recognizing patterns of relations and functions reveals structure and order behind data and processes.

### 1.11.2 Definition & Visual

**Definition of Relation:**  
Given two non-empty sets \( A \) and \( B \), a **relation** \( R \) from \( A \) to \( B \) is a subset of the Cartesian product \( A \times B \). That is,  
\[
R \subseteq A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A,\, b \in B \}.
\]  
If \((a,b) \in R\), we say "\(\,a\) is related to \(b\)" and write \(a R b\).

**Definition of Function:**  
A **function** \( f \) from \( A \) to \( B \) is a special type of relation such that for every \( a \in A \) there exists a **unique** \( b \in B \) with \((a,b) \in f\). In other words, a function assigns exactly one element of \( B \) to each element of \( A \). We denote this as:  
\[
f : A \rightarrow B, \quad f(a) = b.
\]

**Geometric Meaning / Graphical Interpretation:**  
- For finite sets, a relation can be represented as a set of arrows (or links) from elements of \( A \) to elements of \( B \). Multiple elements in \( A \) may relate to the same or different elements in \( B \), and elements of \( A \) may relate to multiple elements of \( B \).  
- For functions, the graphical interpretation becomes more structured: on the plane, if \( A \) and \( B \) are subsets of real numbers (\( \mathbb{R} \)), the function \( f \) is the set of points \((x, f(x))\). The **vertical line test** ensures that any vertical line intersects the graph of a function at most once, indicating the uniqueness of function values for each input.

### 1.11.3 Theorems & Proofs

**Theorem 1 (Uniqueness Condition for Function):**  
A relation \( f \) from \( A \) to \( B \) is a function if and only if for every \( a \in A \), there exists a unique \( b \in B \) such that \((a,b) \in f\).

**Proof:**  
- **Step 1:** Assume \( f \) is a function. Then by definition, for each \( a \in A \) there is *at least one* \( b \in B \) such that \((a,b) \in f\).  
- **Step 2:** To prove uniqueness, suppose for contradiction that there exist \( b_1, b_2 \in B \) with \( b_1 \neq b_2 \) and both \((a,b_1)\) and \((a,b_2)\) belong to \( f \) for some fixed \( a \). This contradicts the definition of function, since \( a \) would associate with two different outputs. Therefore, such \( b_1 \neq b_2 \) cannot exist.  
- **Step 3:** Conversely, if for each \( a \) there exists a unique \( b \) with \((a,b) \in f\), then by definition \( f \) assigns exactly one image to each element in \( A \); hence, \( f \) is a function.

**Hence, the theorem is proved.**

---

**Theorem 2 (Graph of a Function is Unique Correspondence):**  
The graph of a function \( f : A \to B \) in the Cartesian plane does not have two points with the same \( x \)-coordinate and different \( y \)-coordinates.

**Proof:**  
- **Step 1:** By definition, for each \( x \in A \) there is a unique \( y = f(x) \).  
- **Step 2:** Suppose \((x, y_1)\) and \((x, y_2)\) both belong to the graph of \( f \). Since \( f(x) \) is unique, we must have \( y_1 = y_2 \).  
- **Step 3:** Therefore, no vertical line \( x = c \) intersects the graph at more than one point, confirming the uniqueness of \( y \) for each \( x \).

### 1.11.4 Formulas & Working Rule

**Key Formulas:**  
- If \( f : A \to B \) and \( g : B \to C \) are functions, then the **composition of functions** \( g \circ f: A \to C \) is defined as:  
\[
(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)), \quad \forall a \in A.
\]
- The **inverse relation** \( f^{-1} \) of a function \( f \) is the set of ordered pairs \((b,a)\) such that \((a,b) \in f\). The inverse \( f^{-1} \) is a function only if \( f \) is bijective (both one-to-one and onto).

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Solve Problems on Relations and Functions:**  
1. **Identify sets:** Clearly state the domain \( A \) and codomain \( B \) for relations or functions involved.  
2. **Check the relation:** Given pairs or conditions, verify if the set is a relation (subset of \( A \times B \)).  
3. **Check function conditions:** For each element of domain \( A \), ensure there is exactly one corresponding element in \( B \).  
4. **Use graphs:** Plot points \((x, y)\) if possible. Use the vertical line test to verify the function property.  
5. **Operations:** When dealing with compositions, apply the inner function first, then the outer function as per formula.  
6. **Inverse:** For inverse relations, interchange pairs. Check if inverse satisfies function criteria (one-to-one and onto).  
7. **Apply definitions/theorems:** When proving or disproving function or relation property, use uniqueness and existence arguments.  
8. **Edge cases:** Pay attention to domain restrictions or points where function definition may break (e.g., division by zero).

### 1.11.5 Graded Solved Examples

---

**Example 1 (Concept Building - Simple Check of Function):**  
Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{a, b\} \). Consider the relation  
\[
R = \{(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)\}.
\]  
Is \( R \) a function from \( A \) to \( B \)?

**Solution:**  
- **Step 1:** Check each element of \( A \) has at least one related element in \( B \):  
  - \(1 \to a\), \(2 \to b\), \(3 \to a\) — all domain elements covered.  
- **Step 2:** Check uniqueness:  
  - Each element \(1, 2, 3\) maps to exactly one element in \( B \). No element of \( A \) maps to multiple elements in \( B \).  
- **Step 3:** Therefore, \( R \) is a function from \( A \) to \( B \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based - Using Vertical Line Test):**  
Determine whether the curve defined by equation  
\[
y^2 = x
\]  
is a graph of a function \( y = f(x) \).

**Solution:**  
- **Step 1:** Try to express \( y \) as a function of \( x \):  
  \[
  y = \pm \sqrt{x}.
  \]
- **Step 2:** For each \( x > 0 \), there are two values of \( y \): \( +\sqrt{x} \) and \( -\sqrt{x} \).  
- **Step 3:** A vertical line at some \( x_0 > 0 \) intersects the curve at two points, violating the vertical line test.  
- **Step 4:** Therefore, \( y^2 = x \) does **not** represent \( y \) as a function of \( x \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS - Composition of Functions and Inverse Function):**  
Let \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) be defined by  
\[
f(x) = 2x + 3,
\]  
and \( g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by  
\[
g(x) = \frac{x - 3}{2}.
\]

(a) Find \( g \circ f \) and \( f \circ g \).  
(b) Verify if \( g \) is the inverse function of \( f \).

**Solution:**  
- **Step 1 (Find \( g \circ f \)):**  
\[
(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3) = \frac{(2x + 3) - 3}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} = x.
\]
- **Step 2 (Find \( f \circ g \)):**  
\[
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f\left(\frac{x - 3}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{x - 3}{2} + 3 = (x - 3) + 3 = x.
\]
- **Step 3 (Verify inverse):**  
Since \( g \circ f = f \circ g = \text{id} \) (the identity function), \( g \) is the inverse of \( f \).

### 1.11.6 Application in Real Life and Computer Science

**Real Life Examples:**  
- **Student-Grade Mapping:** Assigning grades to students is a function from the set of students to the set of grades. Each student gets exactly one grade.  
- **Employee Salary Database:** Relation between employees and departments is a relation but not necessarily a function (an employee may belong to multiple departments). However, the relation between employee and salary is a function.  
- **Library System:** Mapping books to their authors is a relation. If each book has a unique author, it is a function. One author can write multiple books.

**Use in Computer Science:**  
- **Data Structures:** Functions model maps or dictionaries, associating keys (inputs) with values (outputs).  
- **Programming Functions:** Functions in programming take inputs (arguments) and return outputs, directly reflecting mathematical functions.  
- **Database Relations:** Relational databases store data as tuples in tables, which are relations. Constraints ensure functional dependencies for data integrity.  
- **Graph Theory:** Relations model edges between vertices. Functions model deterministic computations or transitions.

**Graphical Interpretation:**  
Graphs of functions help visualize behavior, domain and range restrictions, and discontinuities. In computer science, flow charts or state diagrams use relations and functions to represent state transitions.
