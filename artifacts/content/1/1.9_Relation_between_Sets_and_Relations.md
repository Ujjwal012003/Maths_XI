Mathematics studies the connections between elements of different sets using the concept of **relations**. This section explores how relations arise naturally as special subsets of Cartesian products of sets and examines important related concepts like domain, range, and inverse relations.

### 1.9.1 Relation as Subset of Cartesian Product

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.9.1:</b> Relation as a subset of Cartesian product <code>A \times B</code> visualized on coordinate pairs</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

Let \( A \) and \( B \) be two non-empty sets. The **Cartesian product** \( A \times B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \):

\[
A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B \}.
\]

A **relation** \( R \) from set \( A \) to set \( B \) is defined as any subset of \( A \times B \):

\[
R \subseteq A \times B.
\]

That is,

\[
R = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A, b \in B, \text{ and } a \text{ is related to } b \text{ by } R \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning (Graphical Interpretation):**

Consider \( A \) and \( B \) as sets of points (such as numbers on number lines or axes). The Cartesian product \( A \times B \) can be visualized as all points on the plane where the horizontal coordinate lies in \( A \) and the vertical coordinate lies in \( B \). Then, a relation \( R \) is simply a collection of points (ordered pairs) chosen from this grid, representing the pairs that satisfy the relation.

For example, if \( A = B = \mathbb{R} \), \( R \) could represent all points \((x, y)\) satisfying some condition (like \( y = x^2 \) defines the "relation" of squaring), and it is a subset of the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\).

---

**Theorem 1 (Relation as Subset):**

\[
\boxed{
\text{Every relation } R \text{ from } A \text{ to } B \text{ is a subset of } A \times B.
}
\]

**Proof:**

1. By definition, a relation \( R \) from set \( A \) to set \( B \) relates elements \( a \in A \) to elements \( b \in B \).

2. Each such related pair \((a, b)\) must belong to the Cartesian product \( A \times B \) because \( A \times B \) is the set of all ordered pairs with first element in \( A \) and second in \( B \).

3. Therefore, the collection of related pairs making up \( R \) must form some subset of \( A \times B \).

Hence, the theorem is proved.

### 1.9.2 Domain and Range of a Relation

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.9.2:</b> Visual representation of domain and range of a relation \( R \subseteq A \times B \)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

Let \( R \subseteq A \times B \) be a relation from \( A \) to \( B \).

- The **domain** of \( R \), denoted \( \mathrm{dom}(R) \), is the set of all elements \( a \in A \) such that \( (a, b) \in R \) for some \( b \in B \):

\[
\mathrm{dom}(R) = \{ a \in A \mid \exists b \in B \text{ such that } (a, b) \in R \}.
\]

- The **range** (or image) of \( R \), denoted \( \mathrm{range}(R) \), is the set of all elements \( b \in B \) such that \( (a, b) \in R \) for some \( a \in A \):

\[
\mathrm{range}(R) = \{ b \in B \mid \exists a \in A \text{ such that } (a, b) \in R \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**

On the Cartesian plane, the domain corresponds to the set of all \( x \)-coordinates of the points in the relation \( R \), and the range corresponds to the set of all \( y \)-coordinates of the points in \( R \). Thus, domain and range project the relation onto the \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis respectively.

---

**Theorem 2 (Domain and Range Properties):**

\[
\boxed{
\mathrm{dom}(R) \subseteq A, \quad \mathrm{range}(R) \subseteq B.
}
\]

**Proof:**

- Since every \( (a,b) \in R \) has \( a \in A \) by definition of \( R \subseteq A \times B \), the set \( \mathrm{dom}(R) \), comprising all such \( a \)'s, must be a subset of \( A \).

- Similarly, for every \( (a,b) \in R \), \( b \in B \); so \( \mathrm{range}(R) \) is a subset of \( B \).

Hence, the theorem is proved.

### 1.9.3 Inverse Relation

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/placeholder" alt="Inverse relation illustration" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;">
<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.9.3:</b> Visualization of the inverse relation \( R^{-1} \) swapping ordered pairs</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

Given a relation \( R \subseteq A \times B \), the **inverse relation** \( R^{-1} \) is defined as the set of ordered pairs obtained by reversing the elements of each pair in \( R \):

\[
R^{-1} = \{ (b, a) \mid (a, b) \in R \}.
\]

Thus, \( R^{-1} \) is a relation from \( B \) to \( A \).

**Geometric Meaning:**

On the Cartesian plane, the inverse relation \( R^{-1} \) is obtained by reflecting the set of points \( (a, b) \) in \( R \) across the line \( y = x \) to get points \( (b, a) \). This swaps the roles of domain and range.

---

**Theorem 3 (Inverse Relation Properties):**

\[
\boxed{
(R^{-1})^{-1} = R.
}
\]

**Proof:**

1. Start with \( R \subseteq A \times B \).

2. By definition, the inverse relation is

\[
R^{-1} = \{ (b,a) \mid (a,b) \in R \} \subseteq B \times A.
\]

3. Consider any pair \( (a,b) \in (R^{-1})^{-1} \). Then, by definition of inverse,

\[
(a,b) \in (R^{-1})^{-1} \iff (b,a) \in R^{-1}.
\]

4. But \( (b,a) \in R^{-1} \) means there exists an \( (a,b) \in R \).

5. Thus, \( (a,b) \in (R^{-1})^{-1} \iff (a,b) \in R \).

Therefore,

\[
(R^{-1})^{-1} = R.
\]

## Formulas & Working Rule

- **Formulas:**

\[
\begin{aligned}
R &\subseteq A \times B, \\
\mathrm{dom}(R) &= \{ a \in A : \exists b \in B, (a,b) \in R \}, \\
\mathrm{range}(R) &= \{ b \in B : \exists a \in A, (a,b) \in R \}, \\
R^{-1} &= \{ (b,a) \mid (a,b) \in R \}, \\
(R^{-1})^{-1} &= R.
\end{aligned}
\]

---

**Working Rule (How to solve problems involving relations and related concepts):**

1. **Identify the sets \( A \) and \( B \)** involved in the relation.

2. **Determine or write the relation \( R \) explicitly** as a set of ordered pairs or via a condition.

3. To find **domain**:
   - List all first elements \( a \) appearing in ordered pairs of \( R \).
   - Collect these without repetition.

4. To find **range**:
   - List all second elements \( b \) appearing in ordered pairs of \( R \).
   - Collect these without repetition.

5. To find **inverse relation \( R^{-1} \)**:
   - Take each pair \( (a,b) \) in \( R \).
   - Swap the elements to form \( (b,a) \).
   - Collect all such pairs.

6. To verify properties, use definitions and set inclusion criteria.

7. For graphical interpretation, plot \( (a,b) \) pairs to visualize relation; reflect around line \( y=x \) to see inverse.

## Graded Solved Examples

### Example 1 (Concept Building - Basic)

**Problem:** Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{4, 5\} \). Define a relation

\[
R = \{ (1,4), (2,4), (3,5) \} \subseteq A \times B.
\]

Find the domain and range of \( R \). Also find \( R^{-1} \).

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Find domain*

- Domain consists of all first elements in the pairs:

\[
\mathrm{dom}(R) = \{1, 2, 3\}.
\]

*Step 2: Find range*

- Range consists of all second elements:

\[
\mathrm{range}(R) = \{4, 5\}.
\]

*Step 3: Find inverse relation \( R^{-1} \)*

- Swap each pair:

\[
R^{-1} = \{ (4,1), (4,2), (5,3) \} \subseteq B \times A.
\]

---

### Example 2 (Competency Based - Intermediate)

**Problem:** Let \( A = \{ a, b, c \} \) and \( B = \{1, 2\} \). Define relation

\[
R = \{(a,1), (b,1), (b,2)\}.
\]

Find \( \mathrm{dom}(R) \), \( \mathrm{range}(R) \), and write \( R^{-1} \). Then list \( \mathrm{dom}(R^{-1}) \) and \( \mathrm{range}(R^{-1}) \).

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Find domain of \( R \)*

\[
\mathrm{dom}(R) = \{a, b\}.
\]

(Since \( c \) does not appear as first component in any pair in \( R \).)

*Step 2: Find range of \( R \)*

\[
\mathrm{range}(R) = \{1, 2\}.
\]

*Step 3: Find inverse relation \( R^{-1} \)*

Swap pairs:

\[
R^{-1} = \{ (1,a), (1,b), (2,b) \} \subseteq B \times A.
\]

*Step 4: Domain and range of \( R^{-1} \)*

- Domain of \( R^{-1} \) is all first elements of \( R^{-1} \) pairs:

\[
\mathrm{dom}(R^{-1}) = \{1, 2\}.
\]

- Range of \( R^{-1} \) is all second elements:

\[
\mathrm{range}(R^{-1}) = \{a, b\}.
\]

---

### Example 3 (HOTS - Master Problem)

**Problem:**

Let \( A = \{1,2,3,4\} \) and \( B = \{5,6,7\} \). A relation \( R \) is defined as

\[
R = \{(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,6)\}.
\]

(i) Find \( \mathrm{dom}(R) \) and \( \mathrm{range}(R) \).

(ii) Find \( R^{-1} \).

(iii) Verify \( (R^{-1})^{-1} = R \) by listing explicit elements.

(iv) Is \( R \) a relation from \( B \) to \( A \)? Justify.

**Solution:**

*Step 1: Domain*

The first components of pairs in \( R \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 4 \):

\[
\mathrm{dom}(R) = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}.
\]

*Step 2: Range*

Second components are \( 5, 5, 6, 7, 6 \); distinct elements:

\[
\mathrm{range}(R) = \{5,6,7\}.
\]

*Step 3: Inverse relation \( R^{-1} \)*

Swap each ordered pair:

\[
R^{-1} = \{(5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (6,4)\}.
\]

*Step 4: Verify \( (R^{-1})^{-1} = R \)*

Find inverse of \( R^{-1} \) by swapping again:

\[
(R^{-1})^{-1} = \{(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,6)\} = R.
\]

Hence, the property is verified.

*Step 5: Is \( R \) a relation from \( B \) to \( A \)?*

No. \( R \) is defined as a subset of \( A \times B \) (first element from \( A \), second from \( B \)). To be a relation from \( B \) to \( A \), \( R \) would need to be a subset of \( B \times A \). Given \( R \)'s pairs have first elements in \( A \) and second in \( B \), \( R \) is **not** a relation from \( B \) to \( A \).

---

**Summary**

In this section, we have rigorously studied how relations are subsets of Cartesian products, identifying their domains, ranges, and inverses with clear definitions, proofs, and problem-solving techniques. Mastery of these concepts lays the foundation for understanding functions and more complex mappings studied in later chapters.
