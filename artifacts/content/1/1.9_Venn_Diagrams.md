### 1.9.1 Graphical Representation of Sets

**Introduction:**  

Venn diagrams offer a powerful visual way to understand sets and their relationships. By representing sets as circles (or other shapes) within a universal space, these diagrams help visualize operations such as union, intersection, complement, and difference for clearer comprehension.

**Formal Definition:**  

A **Venn diagram** visually represents sets as areas within a universal set. For two sets \( A \) and \( B \), their relationship is depicted by two overlapping circles within a universal rectangle.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

- Each circle represents a set.  
- The overlap region illustrates intersection.  
- The union is the combined areas covered by both circles.  
- The area outside a circle within the rectangle represents the complement.

### 1.9.2 Union and Intersection Visualization

**Union of Sets \( A \) and \( B \):**  

The **union** \( A \cup B \) contains all elements that belong to \( A \), or \( B \), or both.

**Venn Diagram Representation:**  

The union is shown by shading both circles \( A \) and \( B \), including their overlapping part.

**Example:**  

Given \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \),  
\[
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.
\]

---

**Intersection of Sets \( A \) and \( B \):**  

The **intersection** \( A \cap B \) contains all elements that belong to both \( A \) and \( B \).

**Venn Diagram Representation:**  

Only the overlapping region of circles \( A \) and \( B \) is shaded.

**Example:**  

With \( A \) and \( B \) as above,  
\[
A \cap B = \{3\}.
\]

---

### 1.9.3 Complement and Difference Representation

**Complement of a Set \( A \):**  

The **complement** \( A' \) consists of all elements in the universal set \( U \) that are **not** in \( A \).

**Venn Diagram Representation:**  

The area outside circle \( A \) but within the rectangle \( U \) is shaded.

**Example:**  

If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \) and \( A = \{1, 3, 5\} \),  
\[
A' = \{2, 4, 6\}.
\]

---

**Difference of Sets \( A \) and \( B \):**  

The **difference** \( A - B \) is the set of elements in \( A \) but not in \( B \).

**Venn Diagram Representation:**  

Only the part of circle \( A \) outside the circle \( B \) is shaded.

**Example:**  

With \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \),  
\[
A - B = \{1, 2\}.
\]

---

**Bold Text: Theorems & Proofs**

**Theorem 1:** For any sets \( A \) and \( B \), the following hold:  

- \( A \cup B = B \cup A \) (Commutative Law)  
- \( A \cap B = B \cap A \) (Commutative Law)  
- \( A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \) (Distributive Law)

**Proof Outline for Commutativity:**  

- To prove \( A \cup B = B \cup A \), note \( x \in A \cup B \iff x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \).  
- By the commutativity of "or", \( x \in B \text{ or } x \in A \iff x \in B \cup A \).  
- Hence, \( A \cup B = B \cup A \).

---

### Formulas & Working Rule

- Union:  
  \[
  A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
  \]
- Intersection:  
  \[
  A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
  \]
- Complement:  
  \[
  A' = \{x : x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A\}
  \]
- Difference:  
  \[
  A - B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Use Venn Diagrams:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify all sets involved and determine the universal set \( U \).  
2. **Step 2:** Draw circles representing each set within a rectangular universal set diagram.  
3. **Step 3:** Shade the area corresponding to the required operation (union, intersection, complement, difference).  
4. **Step 4:** Analyze the shaded area to write sets using set-builder or roster notation.  
5. **Step 5:** Validate your answers through logical reasoning or counting elements.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Draw a Venn diagram of sets \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \). Shade \( A \cup B \).

**Solution:**  

- Shade both circles representing \( A \) and \( B \).  
- Elements in \( A \cup B \) are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
With the same sets, shade \( A \cap B \).

**Solution:**  

- Shade the overlapping section of \( A \) and \( B \) representing the element \( 3 \).  
- Thus, \( A \cap B = \{3\} \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \), \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( B = \{3, 4, 5\} \), find and depict \( (A \cup B)' \).

**Solution:**  

- \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \).  
- The complement \( (A \cup B)' = U - (A \cup B) = \{6\} \).  
- Shade area outside both \( A \) and \( B \) circles, representing the element \( 6 \).

**Remarks:**  

Venn diagrams bridge the gap between abstract sets and intuitive understanding. By mastering their construction and interpretation, students can effectively solve complex set problems involving unions, intersections, complements, and differences.
