### 1.10.1 Union of Sets

**Introduction:**  

The **union** of two sets combines all elements from both sets into one, without repeating any elements.

**Formal Definition:**  

For sets \( A \) and \( B \),  
\[
A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  

On a Venn diagram, \( A \cup B \) is represented by the total area covered by circles \( A \) and \( B \), including their overlap.

---

### Properties of Union:

- **Commutative Law:**  
  \[
  A \cup B = B \cup A.
  \]
- **Associative Law:**  
  \[
  (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C).
  \]
- **Identity Element:**  
  \[
  A \cup \emptyset = A.
  \]

**Proof of Commutative Law:**  
Assume \( x \in A \cup B \). Then \( x \in A \) or \( x \in B \), so \( x \in B \cup A \). Similarly, the other inclusion holds.

---

### 1.10.2 Intersection of Sets

**Introduction:**  

The **intersection** consists of elements common to both sets.

**Formal Definition:**  

For sets \( A \) and \( B \),  
\[
A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  

On a Venn diagram, \( A \cap B \) is the overlap area between \( A \) and \( B \).

---

### Properties of Intersection:

- **Commutative Law:**  
  \[
  A \cap B = B \cap A.
  \]
- **Associative Law:**  
  \[
  (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C).
  \]
- **Absorption Law:**  
  \[
  A \cap B \subseteq A.
  \]

**Proof of Commutative Law:**  
If \( x \in A \cap B \), then \( x \in A \) and \( x \in B \), so \( x \in B \cap A \). The converse also holds.

---

### 1.10.3 Difference of Sets

**Definition:**  

The difference of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of elements in \( A \) that are not in \( B \).  
\[
A - B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  

This is the portion of \( A \) in the Venn diagram excluding the overlap with \( B \).

---

### 1.10.4 Complement of a Set

**Definition:**  

Given the universal set \( U \) containing \( A \), the complement of \( A \) is the set of elements in \( U \) not in \( A \).  
\[
A' = U - A = \{ x : x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A \}.
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  

The region outside \( A \) in the Venn diagram representing \( U \).

---

### 1.10.5 De Morgan's Laws

**Theorem:**  

For any subsets \( A, B \) of a universal set \( U \):  
\[
(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B',
\]
\[
(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'.
\]

**Proof of First Law:**  

- **Step 1:** Let \( x \in (A \cup B)' \), so \( x \notin A \cup B \).  
- **Step 2:** Then \( x \notin A \) and \( x \notin B \).  
- **Step 3:** Hence \( x \in A' \) and \( x \in B' \), so \( x \in A' \cap B' \).  
- **Step 4:** Conversely, if \( x \in A' \cap B' \), then \( x \notin A \) and \( x \notin B \), so \( x \notin A \cup B \).  
- **Step 5:** Therefore, \( (A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' \).

### Formulas & Working Rule

- Union:  
  \[
  A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
  \]
- Intersection:  
  \[
  A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
  \]
- Difference:  
  \[
  A - B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}
  \]
- Complement:  
  \[
  A' = U - A
  \]
- De Morgan's laws:  
  \[
  (A \cup B)' = A' \cap B', \quad (A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**

1. Step 1: Identify the universal set and all given subsets.  
2. Step 2: Apply the set operation definition to find elements satisfying the condition.  
3. Step 3: Use Venn diagrams to visualize complex operations.  
4. Step 4: For complements, ensure knowledge of universal set.  
5. Step 5: Apply De Morgan's laws when simplifying complements of unions or intersections.  
6. Step 6: Check results by analyzing set membership conditions.
