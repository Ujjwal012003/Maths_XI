### 1.11.1 Commutative Laws

**Definition:**  

The order of sets in union and intersection operations does not change the result.

- For union:  
  \[
  A \cup B = B \cup A
  \]
- For intersection:  
  \[
  A \cap B = B \cap A
  \]

**Proof:**  

- Let \( x \) be an arbitrary element.  
- If \( x \in A \cup B \), then \( x \in A \) or \( x \in B \), which means \( x \in B \cup A \).  
- Similarly for intersection, \( x \in A \cap B \implies x \in A \) and \( x \in B \), so \( x \in B \cap A \).

---

### 1.11.2 Associative Laws

**Definition:**  

The grouping of sets in union and intersection operations does not change the result.

- For union:  
  \[
  (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)
  \]
- For intersection:  
  \[
  (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)
  \]

**Proof:**  

- For union, if \( x \in (A \cup B) \cup C \), then \( x \in A \), or \( x \in B \), or \( x \in C \), which is the same as \( x \in A \cup (B \cup C) \).

- The argument is similar for intersection with "and" replacing "or".

---

### 1.11.3 Distributive Laws

**Definition:**  

Union distributes over intersection and vice versa.

- Union over intersection:  
  \[
  A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)
  \]
- Intersection over union:  
  \[
  A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
  \]

**Proof:**  

- First, show \( A \cup (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \) by considering an element \( x \in A \cup (B \cap C) \) and deducing that \( x \) belongs to both \( A \cup B \) and \( A \cup C \).

- Second, show reverse inclusion by taking \( x \in (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \) and demonstrating \( x \in A \cup (B \cap C) \).

---

### 1.11.4 Identity Laws

**Definition:**  

The union or intersection with identity elements leaves a set unchanged.

- Union with empty set:  
  \[
  A \cup \emptyset = A
  \]
- Intersection with universal set \( U \):  
  \[
  A \cap U = A
  \]

**Proof:**  

- Since \( \emptyset \) contains no elements, union with it adds nothing new.

- Universal set contains all elements, so intersection with it retains \( A \).

---

### 1.11.5 Complement Laws

**Definition:**  

The complement of a set relates to the universal set and the empty set.

- Complement of universal set:  
  \[
  U' = \emptyset
  \]
- Complement of empty set:  
  \[
  \emptyset' = U
  \]

**Proof:**  

- The universal set contains all elements, so nothing exists outside it.

- The empty set has no elements; hence, all elements of \( U \) are outside the empty set.

### Formulas & Working Rule

- **Commutative Laws:**  
  \[
  A \cup B = B \cup A, \quad A \cap B = B \cap A
  \]
- **Associative Laws:**  
  \[
  (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C), \quad (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)
  \]
- **Distributive Laws:**  
  \[
  A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C), \quad A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
  \]
- **Identity Laws:**  
  \[
  A \cup \emptyset = A, \quad A \cap U = A
  \]
- **Complement Laws:**  
  \[
  U' = \emptyset, \quad \emptyset' = U
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**  

1. Step 1: Identify the sets and operations involved.  
2. Step 2: Use the respective law to rewrite or simplify set expressions.  
3. Step 3: Verify results using membership and element logic.  
4. Step 4: For proofs, demonstrate set inclusions both ways.  
5. Step 5: Apply Venn diagrams to visually confirm properties.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Prove \( A \cup B = B \cup A \) for \( A = \{1, 3\} \), \( B = \{2, 3\} \).

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

- Step 2: \( B \cup A = \{2, 1, 3\} = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

- Step 3: Set equality holds by element comparison.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Prove distributive law \( A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \) for \( A=\{1\}, B=\{1,2\}, C=\{1,3\} \).

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: Compute \( B \cap C = \{1\} \).

- Step 2: Compute \( A \cup (B \cap C) = \{1\} \).

- Step 3: Compute \( (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) = \{1,2\} \cap \{1,3\} = \{1\} \).

- Step 4: Both sides equal \( \{1\} \), proving the law.

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Show that \( (A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c \).

**Solution:**  

- Step 1: Use the definitions of complement, union, and intersection.

- Step 2: Use element-wise reasoning to prove both inclusions.

- Step 3: Conclude equality by mutual subset relations (De Morgan's law).
