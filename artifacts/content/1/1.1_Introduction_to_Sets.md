### 1.1.1 Definition of a Set

**Introduction:**  
In mathematics, a **set** is a fundamental concept representing a well-defined collection of distinct objects considered as a whole. Understanding sets is crucial as they form the foundation for many branches of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and probability.

**Formal Definition:**  

A **set** is a collection of well-defined and distinct objects, called **elements** or **members** of the set. Sets are usually denoted by uppercase letters such as \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and elements by lowercase letters such as \( a \), \( b \), \( c \).

If \( a \) is an element of set \( A \), it is denoted by  
\[
a \in A,
\]  
and if \( a \) is not an element of \( A \), it is denoted as  
\[
a \notin A.
\]

**Representation of Sets:**  

1. **Roster or Tabular Form:** Lists all the elements explicitly.  
   \[
   A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}
   \]  
   Here, the set \( A \) contains the elements \( 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \).

2. **Set-Builder Form:** Describes properties that characterize the elements of the set.  
   \[
   B = \{x : x \text{ is a natural number less than } 5 \}
   \]  
   This denotes the set of all natural numbers \( x \) such that \( x < 5 \), i.e., \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \).

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Geometrically, sets can be visualized using **Venn diagrams**, where each set is represented as a closed curve in a plane, and the elements of the set are points inside the curve. For example, a circle representing set \( A \) encloses all its elements as points inside it, and other points outside belong to the universal set \( U \) but not to \( A \).

### 1.1.2 Significance and Applications in Mathematics

**Introduction:**  

Sets are the building blocks in mathematics. They help structure various mathematical objects and form the language of modern mathematics. From defining numbers to describing complex spaces, the concept of sets enables us to systematically study collections of objects.

**Applications:**  

- **Functions and Relations:** Defined as sets of ordered pairs.  
- **Probability:** Events are represented as sets of outcomes.  
- **Algebra:** Groups, rings, and fields are sets with algebraic operations.  
- **Calculus:** Domains and ranges of functions are sets.  
- **Logic:** Truth values and propositions often correspond to sets in Boolean algebra.

Because sets can describe any collection of objects (numbers, points, symbols), they are universally applicable.

---

**Theorem 1: Uniqueness of a Set by Its Elements**

**Statement:** Two sets are equal if and only if they have exactly the same elements.

**Formally:**  
\[
A = B \iff (\forall x)(x \in A \iff x \in B).
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Suppose \( A = B \). Then by definition, every element of \( A \) is in \( B \) and vice versa. Hence,  
  \[
  \forall x, \quad x \in A \implies x \in B \quad \text{and} \quad x \in B \implies x \in A.
  \]

- **Step 2:** Conversely, assume  
  \[
  \forall x, \quad x \in A \iff x \in B.
  \]  
  This means every element of \( A \) is in \( B \) and every element of \( B \) is in \( A \). Therefore,  
  \[
  A = B.
  \]

Thus, the sets \( A \) and \( B \) are identical if and only if they contain the same elements.

---

**Important Types of Sets:**

- **Empty or Null Set:** The set with no elements, denoted by  
  \[
  \emptyset = \{\}.
  \]
- **Finite Set:** Has a limited number of elements, e.g., \( C = \{a, b, c\} \).  
- **Infinite Set:** Has infinitely many elements, e.g.,  
  \[
  N = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\},
  \]
  the set of natural numbers.  
- **Universal Set:** Contains all elements under consideration, typically denoted as \( U \).

---

**Formulas & Working Rule for Set Operations:**

- **Union:**  
  \[
  A \cup B = \{x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
  \]
- **Intersection:**  
  \[
  A \cap B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
  \]
- **Difference:**  
  \[
  A - B = \{x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}
  \]
- **Subset:**  
  \[
  A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \implies x \in B).
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Solve Set Problems:**

1. **Step 1:** Identify all the sets involved and their elements or properties.  
2. **Step 2:** Determine the required operation (union, intersection, difference, subset test).  
3. **Step 3:** Apply the definition rigorously to list or describe elements of the resulting set.  
4. **Step 4:** Use Venn diagrams for visualization to check your results.  
5. **Step 5:** Verify if special cases apply, e.g., empty sets or universal sets.  
6. **Step 6:** Conclude by writing the final set explicitly or using set-builder notation.

### 1.1.3 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Let \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{2, 3, 4, 5\} \). Find \( A \cup B \), \( A \cap B \), and \( A - B \).

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** List sets explicitly.  
\[
A = \{1, 2, 3\}, \quad B = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}
\]

**Step 2:** Compute union:  
\[
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
\]

**Step 3:** Compute intersection:  
\[
A \cap B = \{2, 3\}
\]

**Step 4:** Compute difference:  
\[
A - B = \{1\}
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
If \( U = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \) is the universal set, \( A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\} \), and \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \), find \( (A \cup B)^c \) (complement of union).

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Calculate union \( A \cup B \):  
\[
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10\}
\]

**Step 2:** The complement \( (A \cup B)^c \) with respect to \( U \) contains elements in \( U \) but not in \( A \cup B \):  
\[
(A \cup B)^c = U - (A \cup B) = \{7, 9\}
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given  
\[
A = \{x : x \text{ is an integer and } 1 \leq x \leq 10\}
\]
and  
\[
B = \{x : x \text{ is an even integer}\},
\]
find \( A \cap B^c \) (elements in \( A \) but not in \( B \)) and justify your answer.

**Solution:**  
**Step 1:** Write sets explicitly:  
\[
A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}
\]

\[
B = \{\ldots, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \ldots \} \quad \text{(even integers)}
\]

**Step 2:** Restrict \( B \) to elements in \( A \) (since only those are relevant):  
\[
B \cap A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}
\]

**Step 3:** Compute complement of \( B \) with respect to \( A \):  
\[
B^c = U - B
\]

Within \( A \), the complement \( B^c \) is the set of odd integers from 1 to 10:  
\[
B^c = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}
\]

**Step 4:** Therefore,  
\[
A \cap B^c = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}
\]

**Justification:** This is the set of all elements in \( A \) that are not even, precisely the odd integers from 1 to 10.

**Remarks:**  
Sets provide a powerful method for organizing elements and understanding their relationships. Mastery of sets lays the groundwork for advanced mathematical reasoning and problem-solving. Practice with a variety of problems to internalize operations and visualization techniques.
