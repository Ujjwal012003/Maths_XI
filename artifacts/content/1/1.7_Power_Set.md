### 1.7.1 Definition and Examples

**Introduction:**  

The **power set** extends the idea of subsets by collecting all possible subsets of a set—including the empty set and the set itself—into a new set. It is a fundamental concept in set theory and combinatorics.

**Formal Definition:**  

For any set \( S \), its **power set** \( P(S) \) is defined as the set of all subsets of \( S \):  
\[
P(S) = \{ A : A \subseteq S \}.
\]

**Examples:**

1. For \( S = \{a\} \),  
   \[
   P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}\}.
   \]

2. For \( S = \{a, b\} \),  
   \[
   P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}.
   \]

3. For \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \),  
   \[
   P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\}\}.
   \]

### 1.7.2 Number of Subsets of a Set

If a set \( S \) has \( n \) elements, the **number of subsets** of \( S \), equivalently the size of the power set, is:  
\[
|P(S)| = 2^n.
\]

This formula counts every possible subset combination, including the empty subset and \( S \) itself.

### 1.7.3 Relation to Cardinality

**Cardinality of Sets and Power Sets:**  

Let \( |S| = n \) be the cardinality of set \( S \). Then:  
- The cardinality of the power set of \( S \) is \( |P(S)| = 2^n \).  
- This means the power set grows exponentially with the size of the original set.

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Visualizing power sets helps understand the increasing complexity of subsets as the size of the original set grows. Each element independently either is or is not part of a subset, creating \( 2^n \) combinations, akin to binary choices.

**Bold Text: Theorem 1: Cardinality of Power Set**

**Statement:**  

If a set \( S \) has \( n \) elements, the power set \( P(S) \) contains \( 2^n \) subsets.

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Each element of \( S \) can either be included or excluded from a subset.  
- **Step 2:** Since each element has 2 choices, and there are \( n \) elements, total number of subsets is:  
  \[
  2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2 = 2^n.
  \]
- **Step 3:** Hence, the power set contains \( 2^n \) subsets.

### Formulas & Working Rule

- **Power set:**  
  \[
  P(S) = \{A : A \subseteq S\}
  \]
- **Number of subsets (cardinality of \( P(S) \)):**  
  \[
  |P(S)| = 2^{|S|}
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Find Power Set:**  

1. **Step 1:** Identify all elements of the set \( S \).  
2. **Step 2:** List all subsets starting from empty set \( \emptyset \) to full set \( S \).  
3. **Step 3:** For each subset, determine all combinations of elements.  
4. **Step 4:** Count total subsets to verify it matches \( 2^n \).  
5. **Step 5:** Write the power set explicitly, ensuring all subsets are included.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Find the power set of \( S = \{a\} \).

**Solution:**  

- Subsets: \( \emptyset, \{a\} \)  
- Therefore,  
  \[
  P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}\}.
  \]
- Number of subsets \( = 2^1 = 2 \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Find the power set of \( S = \{a, b\} \).

**Solution:**  

- Subsets: \( \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\} \)  
- Therefore,  
  \[
  P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}.
  \]
- Number of subsets \( = 2^2 = 4 \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
If \( S = \{1, 2, 3\} \), list the power set \( P(S) \) and count its number of subsets.

**Solution:**  

- Subsets:  
  \[
  \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}.
  \]

- The power set is:  
  \[
  P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}.
  \]

- Number of subsets \( = 2^3 = 8 \).

**Remarks:**  

The concept of power sets is crucial as it reveals the combinatorial nature of sets and their subsets. Understanding power sets also leads to enhanced understanding of functions, relations, and counting principles, all pivotal topics in mathematics.
