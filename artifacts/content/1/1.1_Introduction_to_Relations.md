In mathematics, the study of how elements from one set relate to elements of another is fundamental. A **relation** mathematically formalizes these connections, generalizing concepts like functions and mappings. Geometrically, relations can be visualized as points or arrows connecting elements across two sets, providing intuition to abstract pairs.

### 1.1.1 Definition of Relation and Geometric Meaning

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.1.2:</b> Relation as arrows between elements of Set A and Set B</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Let \( A \) and \( B \) be two non-empty sets. The **Cartesian product** \( A \times B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \( (a, b) \) where \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \).

Formally, 

\[
A \times B = \{ (a,b) \mid a \in A, \, b \in B \}
\]

A **relation** \( R \) from \( A \) to \( B \) is any subset of the Cartesian product \( A \times B \):

\[
R \subseteq A \times B
\]

That is, 

\[
R = \{ (a,b) \mid a \in A,\, b \in B, \text{ and } a \text{ is related to } b \text{ by } R \}
\]

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Each ordered pair \( (a,b) \in R \) can be represented as a point in the plane, where the horizontal axis corresponds to elements \( a \in A \) and the vertical axis corresponds to elements \( b \in B \). Thus, the relation \( R \) can be visualized as a graph of scattered points representing the pairs \( (a,b) \). 

If \( A = B = \mathbb{R} \), the Cartesian plane itself represents all possible pairs, and the relation is a set of points on this plane that satisfy certain conditions.

### 1.1.2 Cartesian Product of Sets

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.1.3:</b> Cartesian product \( A \times B \) as all possible ordered pairs and grid points</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**  
Given two sets \( A \) and \( B \), the **Cartesian product** \( A \times B \) is defined as:

\[
A \times B = \{ (a,b) \mid a \in A,\, b \in B \}
\]

This means the Cartesian product consists of every possible ordered pair where the first element comes from \( A \), and the second from \( B \).

**Key Properties:**

- If \( A \) has \( m \) elements and \( B \) has \( n \) elements, then the Cartesian product \( A \times B \) has exactly \( m \times n \) elements.
- Cartesian Product is **not commutative**, meaning generally

\[
A \times B \neq B \times A
\]

This is because ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) and \( (b,a) \) are distinct unless \( a = b \).

**Example:**

If \( A = \{1,2\} \) and \( B = \{x,y\} \), then:

\[
A \times B = \{ (1,x), (1,y), (2,x), (2,y) \}
\]

### 1.1.3 Representation of a Relation

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 1.1.4:</b> Relation shown as ordered pairs and directed graph</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Relations can be represented in several equivalent ways:

1. **Set of ordered pairs:**  
The simplest way is listing all pairs in the relation. For example, 

\[
R = \{ (1,2), (2,3), (3,1) \}
\]

2. **Arrow diagrams (Directed graphs):**  
Draw two sets as columns of points. Draw arrows from elements in \( A \) to elements in \( B \) based on the relation pairs.

3. **Matrix Representation:**  
If \( A \) and \( B \) are finite sets, a relation from \( A \) to \( B \) can be represented as a matrix \( M \) with entries:

\[
M_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } (a_i, b_j) \in R \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

where \( a_i \) and \( b_j \) are elements of \( A \) and \( B \) respectively.

### Theorem 1.1: Relation as a Subset of Cartesian Product

\[
\boxed{
\text{Any relation } R \text{ from } A \text{ to } B \text{ is a subset } R \subseteq A \times B.
}
\]

**Proof:**

**Step 1:** By definition, \( A \times B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \).

**Step 2:** A relation \( R \) from \( A \) to \( B \) associates certain elements \( a \in A \) with elements \( b \in B \) via ordered pairs.

**Step 3:** By listing these pairs, \( R \) contains only those ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) that satisfy the relation's condition.

Since all such pairs \( (a,b) \) come from \( A \times B \), it follows that

\[
R \subseteq A \times B.
\]

This completes the proof.

### Formulas and Working Rule for Problems on Relations

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Cartesian Product:} \quad A \times B = \{(a,b) \mid a \in A,\, b \in B \} \\
&\text{Relation } R: R \subseteq A \times B \\
&|A \times B| = |A| \times |B| \quad \text{if } A, B \text{ are finite sets} \\
\end{aligned}
}
\]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Identify or Construct a Relation:**

1. **Identify the two sets \( A \) and \( B \).**  
   Understand the elements and the nature of each set.

2. **Find the Cartesian product \( A \times B \).**  
   List or conceptualize all ordered pairs \( (a,b) \) for \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \).

3. **Apply the relation condition or definition to select pairs.**  
   Use the problem’s rule (e.g., \( b = a + 1 \)) to determine which pairs belong to \( R \).

4. **Represent \( R \) as a subset, either by listing pairs, drawing arrow diagrams, or constructing matrices.**

5. **Verify that the ordered pairs satisfy the relation’s condition for correctness.**

### Examples

#### Example 1 (Concept Building - Basic)

**Problem:**  
Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \) and \( B = \{4,5\} \). Write down the Cartesian product \( A \times B \). Then define relation \( R \) from \( A \) to \( B \) such that 

\[
R = \{ (a,b) \mid b = a + 3 \}.
\]

List \( R \).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** Write the Cartesian product:

\[
A \times B = \{ (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5) \}.
\]

**Step 2:** Apply the relation condition \( b = a + 3 \):

- For \( a=1 \), \( b = 4 \) satisfies \( 4 = 1 + 3 \) (True). Include \( (1,4) \).
- \( (1,5) \): \( 5 = 1 + 3 \) → False.
- For \( a=2 \), \( (2,4) \): \( 4 = 2 + 3 = 5 \) False.
- \( (2,5) \): \( 5 = 2 + 3 \) True. Include \( (2,5) \).
- For \( a=3 \), \( (3,4) \): \( 4 = 3 + 3 = 6 \) False.
- \( (3,5) \): \( 5 = 3 + 3 = 6 \) False.

**Step 3:** Therefore, the relation is:

\[
R = \{ (1,4), (2,5) \}.
\]

#### Example 2 (Competency Based)

**Problem:**  
Given sets \( A = \{2,3,4\} \) and \( B = \{0,1,4\} \), define relation \( R \subseteq A \times B \) such that \( (a,b) \in R \) if and only if \( a \) divides \( b \) (i.e., \( b \% a = 0 \)). List all pairs in \( R \).

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** List \( A \times B \):

\[
\{ (2,0), (2,1), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1), (4,4) \}.
\]

**Step 2:** Check divisibility \( a \mid b \):

- \( (2,0) \): 2 divides 0 (true).
- \( (2,1) \): 2 divides 1? No.
- \( (2,4) \): 2 divides 4? Yes.
- \( (3,0) \): 3 divides 0 (true).
- \( (3,1) \): No.
- \( (3,4) \): No.
- \( (4,0) \): 4 divides 0 (true).
- \( (4,1) \): No.
- \( (4,4) \): 4 divides 4 (yes).

**Step 3:** Thus,

\[
R = \{ (2,0), (2,4), (3,0), (4,0), (4,4) \}.
\]

---

#### Example 3 (HOTS - Higher Order Thinking Skills)

**Problem:**  
Let \( A = \{1,2,3\} \), \( B = \{2,3,4\} \), and define relation \( R \subseteq A \times B \) by:

\[
R = \{ (a,b) \mid b^{2} = a + 3 \}
\]

**(a)** Find all pairs in \( R \).  
**(b)** Represent \( R \) graphically on the Cartesian plane.

**Solution:**

**Part (a):**

Check all pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( a \in A, b \in B \):

- For \( a=1 \), \( b^2 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). So \( b = \pm 2 \). Since \( B = \{2,3,4\} \), only \( b=2 \) is in \( B \). Include \( (1,2) \).
- For \( a=2 \), \( b^2 = 2 + 3 = 5 \). Neither \( \sqrt{5} \) nor \( -\sqrt{5} \) is in \( B \). No pair.
- For \( a=3 \), \( b^2 = 3 + 3 = 6 \). Neither \( \sqrt{6} \) nor \( -\sqrt{6} \) is in \( B \). No pair.

Thus,

\[
R = \{ (1,2) \}.
\]

**Part (b):**

On the Cartesian plane, plot the single point \( (1,2) \), which visually represents the relation.
