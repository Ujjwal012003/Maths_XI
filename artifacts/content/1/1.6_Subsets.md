### 1.6.1 Definition of Subsets

**Introduction:**  

In set theory, the concept of a **subset** allows us to understand how one set can be contained within another. This helps organize sets in a hierarchy based on their elements.

**Formal Definition:**  

A set \( A \) is called a **subset** of a set \( B \), denoted by  
\[
A \subseteq B,
\]
if every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \). Formally,  
\[
A \subseteq B \iff \forall x \, (x \in A \implies x \in B).
\]

---

**Geometric Meaning:**  

Geometrically, we can illustrate \( A \subseteq B \) with a Venn diagram where all points representing elements of \( A \) lie inside the circle representing the set \( B \).

---

### 1.6.2 Proper and Improper Subsets

**Proper Subset:**  

A set \( A \) is a **proper subset** of a set \( B \), denoted by  
\[
A \subset B,
\]
if \( A \subseteq B \) but \( A \neq B \). This means all elements of \( A \) are in \( B \), but \( B \) contains at least one element not in \( A \).

**Improper Subset:**  

If \( A = B \), then \( A \) is an **improper subset** of \( B \).

---

### 1.6.3 Empty Set as a Subset

The **empty set**, denoted by \( \emptyset \), is a subset of every set. This is because there is no element in the empty set that violates the subset condition.

Formally,  
\[
\emptyset \subseteq A,
\]
for any set \( A \).

---

### 1.6.4 Power Set Introduction

The **power set** of a set \( A \), denoted \( P(A) \), is the set of all subsets of \( A \), including the empty set and \( A \) itself.

**Example:**  

For \( A = \{a, b\} \),  
\[
P(A) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}.
\]

The number of subsets in the power set of a set with \( n \) elements is \( 2^n \).

---

**Bold Text: Theorems & Proofs**

**Theorem 1:** The empty set is a subset of every set.

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** By definition, \( \emptyset \) contains no elements.  
- **Step 2:** To be a subset, every element of \( \emptyset \) must also be in \( A \).  
- **Step 3:** Since there are no elements in \( \emptyset \), the condition holds vacuously.  
- **Step 4:** Therefore,  
  \[
  \emptyset \subseteq A.
  \]

---

### Formulas & Working Rule

- Subset condition:  
  \[
  A \subseteq B \iff \forall x (x \in A \implies x \in B)
  \]
- Proper subset condition:  
  \[
  A \subset B \iff (A \subseteq B) \land (A \neq B)
  \]
- Power set cardinality:  
  \[
  |P(A)| = 2^{|A|}
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Check Subsets:**  

1. **Step 1:** For each element of \( A \), verify whether it is also in \( B \).  
2. **Step 2:** If all elements of \( A \) are in \( B \), conclude \( A \subseteq B \).  
3. **Step 3:** To check for proper subset, also verify \( A \neq B \).  
4. **Step 4:** To find the power set, list all subsets of \( A \), including \( \emptyset \) and \( A \) itself.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Verify if \( A = \{1, 2\} \) is a subset of \( B = \{1, 2, 3\} \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** Elements of \( A \) are 1 and 2.  
- **Step 2:** Both 1 and 2 are in \( B \).  

Thus,  
\[
A \subseteq B.
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Is \( A = \{1, 3\} \) a proper subset of \( B = \{1, 2, 3\} \)?

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** Check if \( A \subseteq B \): Yes, both 1 and 3 are in \( B \).  
- **Step 2:** Compare \( A \) and \( B \): \( A \neq B \).  

Hence,  
\[
A \subset B.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Find the power set of \( C = \{x, y, z\} \) and state its cardinality.

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** List all subsets:  
  \[
  \emptyset, \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\}, \{x,y\}, \{y,z\}, \{x,z\}, \{x,y,z\}
  \]
- **Step 2:** There are 8 subsets.

Thus,  
\[
P(C) = \{\emptyset, \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\}, \{x,y\}, \{y,z\}, \{x,z\}, \{x,y,z\}\}, \quad |P(C)|=8.
\]

**Remarks:**  

Understanding subsets, including proper and improper ones, and the concept of power sets, is essential for grasping more complex mathematical structures and operations in set theory. Recognize the empty set’s pivotal role and how power sets expand the universe of subsets for a given set.
