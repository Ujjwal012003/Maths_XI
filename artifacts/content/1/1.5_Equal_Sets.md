### 1.5.1 Conditions for Equality of Sets

**Introduction:**  

In set theory, equality of sets is a foundational concept that states two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. The order of elements or repetition does not matter.

**Formal Definition:**  

Two sets \( A \) and \( B \) are said to be **equal**, denoted \( A = B \), if every element of \( A \) is also an element of \( B \) and every element of \( B \) is also an element of \( A \). Formally,  
\[
A = B \iff \forall x \, (x \in A \iff x \in B).
\]
This means for **every** element \( x \), belonging to \( A \) is exactly equivalent to belonging to \( B \).

---

**Geometric Meaning:**  

In a Venn diagram, equal sets correspond to two circles overlapping perfectly such that every element inside one circle is also inside the other, indicating complete equality.

### 1.5.2 Theorems & Proofs

**Bold Text: Theorem 1 (Characterization of Equal Sets):**  
\[
A = B \iff A \subseteq B \text{ and } B \subseteq A.
\]

**Proof:**  

- **Step 1:** Assume \( A = B \). By definition, every element in \( A \) is in \( B \), so \( A \subseteq B \). Similarly, every element in \( B \) is in \( A \), so \( B \subseteq A \).

- **Step 2:** Conversely, assume \( A \subseteq B \) and \( B \subseteq A \).

- **Step 3:** If every element of \( A \) is in \( B \) and every element of \( B \) is in \( A \), then both sets have exactly the same elements.

- **Step 4:** Therefore, \( A = B \).

### 1.5.3 Formulas & Working Rule

- **Equality condition:**  
  \[
  A = B \iff (A \subseteq B) \land (B \subseteq A)
  \]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) to Prove Equality of Sets:**  

1. **Step 1:** To show \( A = B \), first prove \( A \subseteq B \):  
   Take an arbitrary element \( x \in A \). Show that \( x \in B \).

2. **Step 2:** Next, prove \( B \subseteq A \):  
   Take an arbitrary element \( y \in B \). Show that \( y \in A \).

3. **Step 3:** From these two subset relations, conclude \( A = B \).

### 1.5.4 Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Prove that \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \) and \( B = \{3, 2, 1\} \) are equal.

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** Take \( x \in A \). Since \( A = \{1, 2, 3\} \), \( x \) is either 1, 2, or 3. All these are in \( B \).  
  
- **Step 2:** Take \( y \in B \). Since \( B = \{3, 2, 1\} \), \( y \) is either 3, 2, or 1. All these are in \( A \).  

- **Step 3:** Since \( A \subseteq B \) and \( B \subseteq A \), by the theorem, \( A = B \).

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Let \( C = \{x : x \text{ is a prime number less than } 10\} \) and \( D = \{2, 3, 5, 7\} \). Prove \( C = D \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** Suppose \( x \in C \). By definition, \( x \) is a prime less than 10, so \( x \in \{2, 3, 5, 7\} = D \). Hence \( C \subseteq D \).

- **Step 2:** Take \( y \in D \). By \( D \)'s construction, \( y \) is a prime less than 10, so \( y \in C \). Hence \( D \subseteq C \).

- **Step 3:** Therefore, \( C = D \).

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Let \( A = \{x : x^2 = 1\} \) and \( B = \{-1, 1\} \). Prove \( A = B \).

**Solution:**  

- **Step 1:** If \( x \in A \), then \( x^2 = 1 \), which implies \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \). So \( x \in B \), thus \( A \subseteq B \).

- **Step 2:** If \( y \in B \), then \( y = -1 \) or \( y = 1 \). Thus \( y^2 = 1 \), so \( y \in A \), hence \( B \subseteq A \).

- **Step 3:** Thus, \( A = B \).

**Remarks:**  

Equality of sets is the fundamental equivalence relation in set theory, allowing us to identify when two sets represent the same collection of objects. Mastery of subset proofs is essential for rigorous problem-solving and further study in mathematics.
