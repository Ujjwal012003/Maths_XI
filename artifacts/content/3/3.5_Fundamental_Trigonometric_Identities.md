**Definition & Geometric Meaning:**

The fundamental Pythagorean identity is:

\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.
\]

This identity signifies that for any angle \( x \), the sum of the squares of sine and cosine equals one, echoing the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle where the radius is 1.

---

**Theorem (Pythagorean Identity):**

\[
\boxed{
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.
}
\]

---

**Proof using the Unit Circle:**

- Step 1: Consider the unit circle centered at the origin with radius 1. Any point on this circle corresponding to angle \( x \) has coordinates \( (\cos x, \sin x) \).
  
- Step 2: By the definition of the unit circle:

\[
(\cos x)^2 + (\sin x)^2 = 1^2,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1.
\]

Hence, the identity is proved.

---

### 3.5.2 Other Forms of Pythagorean Identities

From the primary identity, dividing by \( \cos^2 x \) (with \( \cos x \neq 0 \)) and \( \sin^2 x \) (with \( \sin x \neq 0 \)) respectively, we derive:

\[
\tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x,
\]

and

\[
1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x.
\]

These identities relate the tangent and cotangent functions to their reciprocal secant and cosecant functions.

---

**Theorem:**

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
& \tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x, \\
& 1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x.
\end{aligned}
}
\]

---

**Proof:**

- Step 1: Starting with the fundamental identity:

\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.
\]

- Step 2: Divide each term by \( \cos^2 x \) (where \( \cos x \neq 0 \)):

\[
\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \implies \tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x.
\]

- Step 3: Similarly, dividing by \( \sin^2 x \) (where \( \sin x \neq 0 \)):

\[
\frac{\sin^2 x}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} \implies 1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x.
\]

### Formulas Summary

\[
\boxed{

\end{aligned}
}
\]

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Using Pythagorean Identities:

1. **Identify** the trigonometric expression to simplify or equation to solve.  
2. **Check** if terms can be expressed using sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, or cosecant.  
3. **Apply** the relevant Pythagorean identity to substitute or relate expressions.  
4. **Simplify** the resulting expression or solve the equation accordingly.  
5. **Verify** any constraints due to division by zero or domain restrictions.

### Graded Solved Examples

---

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Verify the identity \( \sin^2 45^\circ + \cos^2 45^\circ = 1 \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Find sine and cosine of \(45^\circ\):
\[
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

- Step 2: Calculate left side:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1.
\]

- Step 3: Left side equals right side, confirming the identity.

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Simplify \( \tan^2 x \cdot \sec^2 x - \tan^2 x \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Use the identity \( \tan^2 x + 1 = \sec^2 x \), so substitute:

\[
\tan^2 x \cdot \sec^2 x - \tan^2 x = \tan^2 x (\sec^2 x - 1).
\]

- Step 2: Replace \( \sec^2 x - 1 \) by \( \tan^2 x \):

\[
= \tan^2 x \cdot \tan^2 x = \tan^4 x.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Given \( \sin x = \frac{3}{5} \) with \( x \) in the first quadrant, find \( \tan^2 x \) and \( \sec^2 x \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Use the fundamental identity:

\[
\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x = 1 - \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^2 = 1 - \frac{9}{25} = \frac{16}{25}.
\]

- Step 2: Find \( \cos x \):

\[
\cos x = \sqrt{\frac{16}{25}} = \frac{4}{5} \quad (\text{positive in first quadrant}).
\]

- Step 3: Calculate \( \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{3/5}{4/5} = \frac{3}{4} \).

Therefore,

\[
\tan^2 x = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{16}.
\]

- Step 4: Use identity \( \sec^2 x = 1 + \tan^2 x \):

\[
\sec^2 x = 1 + \frac{9}{16} = \frac{25}{16}.
\]
