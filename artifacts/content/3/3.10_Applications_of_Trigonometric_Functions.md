**Introduction:**

Trigonometric functions play an important role in solving real-world problems involving angles and distances. From calculating heights and distances to modeling periodic phenomena, the applications of trigonometry extend far beyond theory into practical scenarios. This section explores various classic applications, equipping students with the methodology to approach and solve such problems using trigonometric concepts.

### 3.10.1 Height and Distance Problems

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.10.2:</b> Angle of elevation and distance in height and distance problem</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

Height and distance problems involve calculating the height of an object or the distance between two objects using measures of angles of elevation or depression and trigonometric functions.

**Geometric Meaning:**

- The problem is modeled with right triangles where trigonometric ratios such as sine, cosine, and tangent represent the relationships between height, distance, and angles.
- Angles of elevation and depression are angles formed with the horizontal or ground level.

---

**Formulas & Concepts:**

For a right triangle with height \(h\), distance \(d\), and angle \( \theta \):

- Angle of elevation:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{h}{d} \implies h = d \tan \theta.
\]

- Angle of depression uses the same relation, considering geometry.

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**

1. Identify the given quantities — angle of elevation/depression, distance, or height.
2. Draw a diagram representing the scenario as a right triangle.
3. Choose the correct trigonometric ratio based on known sides/angles.
4. Formulate the equation using sine, cosine, or tangent.
5. Solve for the unknown quantity using algebraic manipulation.

---

**Example:**

A person standing 50 m away from a tower observes an angle of elevation of \( 30^\circ \). Find the height of the tower.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Let height of tower = \(h\), distance \(d = 50\) m.
- Step 2: Using tangent relation:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{h}{50}.
\]

- Step 3: \( \tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \), so

\[
h = 50 \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{50 \sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 28.87 \text{ m}.
\]

### 3.10.2 Inclination and Bearings

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.10.3:</b> Representation of bearing and inclination with directions and angles</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

- **Inclination** is the angle made by a line or surface with the horizontal.
- **Bearing** refers to the direction of an object in navigation, measured clockwise from north.

**Geometric Interpretation:**

- Bearings are expressed as angles from the north direction on the compass rose, and trigonometric functions help calculate components of displacement.
- The problem is often modeled in coordinate planes or right triangles.

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**

1. Identify the bearing angle given or to be found.
2. Represent the problem on a north-south and east-west coordinate system.
3. Use trigonometric functions to find distances or angles based on bearings.
4. Solve the problem using known ratios and coordinate geometry.

---

**Example:**

A ship sails on a bearing of \( 60^\circ \) for 30 km. Compute the eastward and northward distances covered.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Let eastward distance = \(x\), northward distance = \(y\).
- Step 2: From bearing \(60^\circ\):

\[
x = 30 \sin 60^\circ = 30 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15 \sqrt{3} \approx 25.98 \text{ km}.
\]

\[
y = 30 \cos 60^\circ = 30 \times \frac{1}{2} = 15 \text{ km}.
\]

### 3.10.3 Modeling Periodic Phenomena

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.10.4:</b> Sine wave modeling periodic natural phenomena</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition:**

Periodic phenomena are natural or physical processes that repeat values over time, modeled effectively by trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

**Geometric Meaning:**

- The periodicity of sine and cosine graphs represents cycles in phenomena like sound waves, tides, daylight hours, and mechanical vibrations.

---

**Working Rule (Algorithm):**

1. Identify periodic nature and period \(T\).
2. Represent the quantity as a function \( y = A \sin (\omega t + \phi) \) or \( y = A \cos (\omega t + \phi) \), where \( \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} \).
3. Use initial conditions to find amplitude \(A\), phase shift \( \phi \).
4. Use the function to predict future behavior or other quantities.

---

**Example:**

A city's daylight hours vary periodically with period 365 days. Suppose the amount of daylight \(D\) days after January 1 is modeled by:

\[
D = 12 + 3 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{365} t \right).
\]

Find daylight hours 91 days after January 1 (April 1).

**Solution:**

- Step 1:

\[
D = 12 + 3 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{365} \times 91 \right).
\]

- Step 2:

Calculate inside sine:

\[
\frac{2\pi}{365} \times 91 = \frac{182\pi}{365} \approx 1.567 \text{ radians}.
\]

- Step 3:

Calculate:

\[
\sin 1.567 \approx 0.9999.
\]

- Step 4:

So,

\[
D \approx 12 + 3 \times 0.9999 = 15 \text{ hours (approximately)}.
\]

**Solution:**

- Step 1:

\[
\text{Eastward} = 40 \sin 60^\circ = 40 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 20 \sqrt{3}.
\]

- Step 2:

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
The temperature varies sinusoidally during the day as:

\[
T(t) = 15 + 10 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{12} t - \frac{\pi}{2} \right),
\]

where \(t\) is time in hours after midnight. Find the temperature at 6 AM.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Substitute \( t = 6 \).

- Step 2:

\[
T(6) = 15 + 10 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{12} \times 6 - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 15 + 10 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 15 + 10 \sin 0 = 15.
