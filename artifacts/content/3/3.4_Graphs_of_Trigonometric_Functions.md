<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.4.2:</b> Graphs of sine and cosine functions showing amplitude and period</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition and Geometric Meaning:**

- The **sine function** \( y = \sin x \) maps an angle \( x \) to the vertical coordinate on the unit circle.
- The **cosine function** \( y = \cos x \) maps an angle \( x \) to the horizontal coordinate on the unit circle.

Both functions produce smooth wave-like graphs oscillating between \(-1\) and \(1\).

**Key Properties:**

- **Periodicity:** Both sine and cosine functions repeat values every \( 2\pi \) radians, i.e.,  
\[
\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin x, \quad \cos(x + 2\pi) = \cos x.
\]
- **Amplitude:** The maximum absolute value they attain is 1.  
- **Symmetry:**  
  - Sine is an **odd function**, meaning  
  \[
  \sin(-x) = -\sin x.
  \]
  - Cosine is an **even function**, meaning  
  \[
  \cos(-x) = \cos x.
  \]

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.4.3:</b> Graph of tangent function showing vertical asymptotes at \( \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \)</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition and Geometric Meaning:**

- The **tangent function** \( y = \tan x \) can be seen as the slope of the line from the origin to a point on the unit circle.
- The **cotangent function** \( y = \cot x \) is the reciprocal of tangent.

These functions exhibit vertical asymptotes where cosine or sine are zero, respectively.

**Key Properties:**

- **Periodicity:** Both have period \(\pi\), i.e.,  
\[
\tan(x + \pi) = \tan x, \quad \cot(x + \pi) = \cot x.
\]
- **Amplitude:** These values are unbounded.
- **Symmetry:** Both are odd functions:  
\[
\tan(-x) = - \tan x, \quad \cot(-x) = - \cot x.
\]
- **Asymptotes:**  
  - Tangent has vertical asymptotes at \( x = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}, \pm \frac{3\pi}{2}, \ldots \)  
  - Cotangent has vertical asymptotes at \( x = 0, \pm \pi, \pm 2\pi, \ldots \)

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.4.4:</b> Graph of secant function showing vertical asymptotes and oscillating peaks</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Definition and Geometric Meaning:**

- **Secant function** \( y = \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x} \) takes reciprocal values of cosine.
- **Cosecant function** \( y = \csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x} \) takes reciprocal values of sine.

Their graphs have vertical asymptotes corresponding to zeros of the respective denominators.

**Key Properties:**

- **Periodicity:** Both have period \( 2\pi \),  
\[
\sec(x + 2\pi) = \sec x, \quad \csc(x + 2\pi) = \csc x.
\]
- **Symmetry:**  
  - Secant is an even function:  
  \[
  \sec(-x) = \sec x.
  \]
  - Cosecant is an odd function:  
  \[
  \csc(-x) = -\csc x.
  \]
- **Amplitude:** Neither function has a finite amplitude; their values tend to infinity near asymptotes.

### 3.4.4 Periodicity, Amplitude, and Symmetry of Graphs

**Periodicity:**  
- **Sine and Cosine:** Period \( 2\pi \).  
- **Tangent and Cotangent:** Period \( \pi \).  
- **Secant and Cosecant:** Period \( 2\pi \).

**Amplitude:**  
- **Sine and Cosine:** Amplitude is 1 (maximum absolute value).  
- **Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant:** No fixed amplitude (values can tend to infinity).

**Symmetry:**  
- **Even Functions:** Cosine and Secant satisfy \( f(-x) = f(x) \).  
- **Odd Functions:** Sine, Tangent, Cotangent, and Cosecant satisfy \( f(-x) = -f(x) \).

### 3.4.5 Quadrantal Angles and Their Graphical Significance

**Quadrantal angles** are the multiples of \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) (or 90°), such as \( 0, \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi, \frac{3\pi}{2}, 2\pi \), etc. They correspond to key points on the unit circle.

**Graphical Significance:**

- At quadrantal angles, sine and cosine values are either 0 or \( \pm 1 \).
- Tangent and cotangent functions have vertical asymptotes at some quadrantal angles (e.g., tangent is undefined at \( \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \)).
- Secant and cosecant have vertical asymptotes corresponding to the zeros of cosine and sine, respectively, which occur at quadrantal angles.

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Sketching Graphs of Trigonometric Functions

1. **Identify the function type** (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.).  
2. **Determine period and amplitude**:  
   - Use the period to know one full cycle length.  
   - Use the amplitude to know maximum and minimum values (if finite).  
3. **Mark key points:**  
   - For sine and cosine, mark maxima, minima, and zeros.  
   - For tangent and cotangent, mark vertical asymptotes and zeros.  
   - For secant and cosecant, locate vertical asymptotes and oscillating peaks.  
4. **Use symmetry:**  
   - Use even/odd nature to plot the graph on negative axes accordingly.  
5. **Plot the curve smoothly between key points** to complete one period.  
6. **Repeat the pattern using periodicity to sketch over the desired \(x\)-range.**
