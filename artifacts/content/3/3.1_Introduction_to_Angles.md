**Introduction:**

Angles form one of the fundamental concepts in geometry and trigonometry. Intuitively, an angle represents the amount of rotation or turning between two lines or rays with a common starting point, called the vertex. Understanding angles is essential for analyzing shapes, slopes of lines, and circular motion.

### 3.1.1 Definition of Angles

</figure>

**Definition:**  
An **angle** is defined as the figure formed by two rays (called the sides of the angle) sharing a common endpoint called the **vertex**. The two rays are named the **initial side** and the **terminal side** (or arm) of the angle.

**Geometric Meaning:**  
Geometrically, an angle measures the amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side about the vertex. On the Cartesian plane, if the initial side lies along the positive x-axis, then the angle corresponds to the rotation measured from this axis to the terminal side.

**Types of Angles:**

- **Acute angle:** An angle less than \(90^\circ\).
- **Right angle:** Exactly \(90^\circ\).
- **Obtuse angle:** Greater than \(90^\circ\) but less than \(180^\circ\).
- **Straight angle:** Exactly \(180^\circ\).
- **Reflex angle:** Greater than \(180^\circ\) but less than \(360^\circ\).

</figure>

**Angle Measurement:**

Angles can be measured in two common units:

- **Degrees** (\(^\circ\)): The full rotation around a point is divided into 360 equal parts, making \(1^\circ = \frac{1}{360}\) of a full rotation.
- **Radians** (\(\text{rad}\)): Based on the radius of the circle, one radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.

The **degree** is common in everyday use, while the **radian** is fundamental in mathematical and scientific contexts.

**Relationship Between Degrees and Radians:**

The entire circumference of a circle corresponds to an angle of \(360^\circ\) or \(2\pi\) radians. Thus:

\[
360^\circ = 2\pi \text{ radians}
\]

From this, it follows that:

\[
1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \text{ radian} = \frac{180}{\pi}^\circ.
\]

<figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;"><i><b>Figure 3.1.4:</b> Conversion between degrees and radians</i></figcaption>
</figure>

**Formulae for Conversion:**

\[
\text{Angle in radians} = \text{Angle in degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

\[
\text{Angle in degrees} = \text{Angle in radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
\]

**Working Rule (Algorithm) for Conversion:**

1. **To convert degrees to radians:**  
   - Step 1: Take the given angle in degrees.  
   - Step 2: Multiply the angle by \(\frac{\pi}{180}\).  
   - Step 3: Simplify the expression (approximate if necessary using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\)) to get the angle in radians.

2. **To convert radians to degrees:**  
   - Step 1: Take the given angle in radians.  
   - Step 2: Multiply the angle by \(\frac{180}{\pi}\).  
   - Step 3: Simplify or approximate to obtain the angle in degrees.

**Theorem (Relationship Between Degrees and Radians):**  
**For any angle, its measure in radians and degrees satisfy:**

\[
\text{radians} = \frac{\pi}{180} \times \text{degrees} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{degrees} = \frac{180}{\pi} \times \text{radians}.
\]

**Proof:**

- Consider a circle of radius \(r\).  
- The length of the full circumference \(C = 2\pi r\).  
- One full rotation corresponds to \(360^\circ\) or the entire circumference.

**Step 1:** By definition of radian measure, the angle \(\theta\) in radians subtends an arc length \(s = r \theta.\)  
**Step 2:** For the entire circle, when the arc length \(s = 2 \pi r\), the angle corresponds to \(2 \pi\) radians.  
**Step 3:** Since this rotation equals \(360^\circ\), we equate:

\[
360^\circ = 2 \pi \text{ radians}.
\]

**Step 4:** Divide both sides by 360:

\[
1^\circ = \frac{2 \pi}{360} = \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians}.
\]

**Step 5:** Similarly, dividing \(360^\circ = 2 \pi\) radians by \(2 \pi\):

\[
1 \text{ radian} = \frac{360^\circ}{2 \pi} = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}.
\]

Thus, the conversion formulas hold.

### Formulas Summary:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
1^\circ &= \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ radians}, \\
1 \text{ radian} &= \frac{180}{\pi}^\circ, \\
\text{Angle in radians} &= \text{Angle in degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}, \\
\text{Angle in degrees} &= \text{Angle in radians} \times \frac{180}{\pi}.
\end{aligned}
}

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Given angle \(= 45^\circ.\)  
- Step 2: Use conversion formula:  
\[
\text{radians} = 45 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]
- Step 3: Thus, \(45^\circ = \frac{\pi}{4}\) radians.

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
An angle measures \(\frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians. Convert this angle to degrees.

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Given angle \(= \frac{3\pi}{2}\) radians.  
- Step 2: Use conversion formula:  
\[
\text{degrees} = \frac{3\pi}{2} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{3 \times 180}{2} = 270^\circ.

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
A wheel rotates through an angle of \(500^\circ\). Find the equivalent radian measure and additionally, express the result in terms of \(\pi\).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Given angle \(= 500^\circ.\)  
- Step 2: Convert degrees to radians:  

\[
500 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{500 \pi}{180} = \frac{50 \pi}{18} = \frac{25 \pi}{9}.
\]

- Step 3: Simplify the fraction as done above.  
- Step 4: Thus, the angle in radians is \(\frac{25\pi}{9}\).

- Step 5: For approximate decimal value, use \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):

\[
\frac{25 \times 3.1416}{9} \approx 8.7266 \text{ radians}.
\]
