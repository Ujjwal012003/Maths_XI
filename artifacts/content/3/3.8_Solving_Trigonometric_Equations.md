**Introduction:**

Solving trigonometric equations is a fundamental aspect of trigonometry, which enables us to find all possible angles satisfying a given trigonometric condition. The equations often have infinitely many solutions due to the periodic nature of trigonometric functions. In this section, we explore methods to solve basic trigonometric equations, utilize trigonometric identities to simplify problems, and express solutions in their general forms.

### 3.8.1 Basic Trigonometric Equations

**Definition:**  
A trigonometric equation is an equation that involves trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, and their reciprocals. It may generally be expressed as:

\[
f(x) = c,
\]

where \(f(x)\) is a trigonometric function and \(c\) is a constant.

**Geometric Meaning:**  
On the unit circle, solving such equations corresponds to finding all angles \(x\) for which the function equals the given constant, considering the periodicity.

### 3.8.2 Use of Identities in Solving Equations

**Theorem (Trigonometric Identities Application):**  
Trigonometric identities allow transformation of complex equations into simpler forms that are easier to solve. This includes Pythagorean identities, angle sum and difference formulas, double angle and half angle formulas.

**Proof (Conceptual):**  
Using identities like

\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1,
\]

or

\[
\sin(x \pm y) = \sin x \cos y \pm \cos x \sin y,
\]

we rewrite equations into equivalents where solutions can be obtained by standard techniques.

### 3.8.3 General Solutions for Equations

**General Solution Forms:**  

- For \( \sin x = k \), with \( -1 \leq k \leq 1 \):

\[
\boxed{
x = \arcsin k + 2n\pi, \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pi - \arcsin k + 2n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
}
\]

- For \( \cos x = k \), with \( -1 \leq k \leq 1 \):

\[
\boxed{
x = \pm \arccos k + 2n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
}
\]

- For \( \tan x = k \), with \( k \in \mathbb{R} \):

\[
\boxed{
x = \arctan k + n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}
}
\]

---

### Formulas Summary

\[
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
& \sin x = k \implies x = \arcsin k + 2n\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pi - \arcsin k + 2n\pi, \\
& \cos x = k \implies x = \pm \arccos k + 2n\pi, \\
& \tan x = k \implies x = \arctan k + n\pi.
\end{aligned}
}
\]

### Working Rule (Algorithm) for Solving Trigonometric Equations:

1. **Simplify the equation:** Use algebraic manipulation and trigonometric identities to reduce the equation to a basic form involving sine, cosine, or tangent equal to a constant.
2. **Find principal solution(s):** Use inverse trigonometric functions or known special angle values.
3. **Write general solutions:** Add periodic terms \( 2n\pi \) for sine and cosine functions, and \( n\pi \) for tangent, to account for all possible solutions.
4. **Check domain constraints:** Verify that the values satisfy the original domain restrictions and equation.

### Graded Solved Examples

**Example 1 (Concept Building):**  
Solve \( \sin x = \frac{1}{2} \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Principal solutions: \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \) and \( x = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \).
- Step 2: General solution:

\[
x = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2n\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2n\pi, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

---

**Example 2 (Competency Based):**  
Solve \( 2 \cos^2 x - 3 \cos x + 1 = 0 \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Let \( u = \cos x \), rewrite:

\[
2 u^2 - 3 u + 1 = 0.
\]

- Step 2: Factorize:

\[
(2u - 1)(u - 1) = 0 \implies u = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad u = 1.
\]

- Step 3: Solve for \( x \):

For \( \cos x = \frac{1}{2} \): 

\[
x = \pm \frac{\pi}{3} + 2n\pi.
\]

For \( \cos x = 1 \):

\[
x = 2n\pi.
\]

---

**Example 3 (HOTS):**  
Solve \( \sin 2x = \sqrt{3} \cos x \) for \( x \in [0, 2\pi] \).

**Solution:**

- Step 1: Use double angle formula: \( \sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x \).

Rewrite the equation:

\[
2 \sin x \cos x = \sqrt{3} \cos x.
\]

- Step 2: Bring all terms to one side:

\[
2 \sin x \cos x - \sqrt{3} \cos x = 0,
\]

or

\[
\cos x (2 \sin x - \sqrt{3}) = 0.
\]

- Step 3: Solve each factor:

- \( \cos x = 0 \implies x = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}. \)  
- \( 2 \sin x - \sqrt{3} = 0 \implies \sin x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies x = \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{2\pi}{3}. \)
