Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". ",

John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. ",

In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The ",

So, we need to extend the real number system to a larger system so that we can find the solution of the equation $x^{2} = -1$ . In fact, the main objective is to solve the equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ , where $\\mathrm{D} = b^{2} - 4ac < 0$ , which is not possible in the system of real numbers. ",

This triangular arrangement is also found in the work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ , for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7$ and Oughtred (1631) gave them for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10$ . The arithmetic triangle, popularly known as Pascal's triangle and similar to the Meru-Prastara of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) in 1665. ",

Euler proved it could not be done because he worked out that, to have an odd vertex you would have to begin or end the trip at that vertex. (Think about it). Since there can only be one beginning and one end, there can only be two odd vertices if you are to trace over each arc only once. Since the bridge problem has 4 odd vertices, it just not possible to do! ",

Obviously, the most important question is to decide whether our model is a good one or not i.e., when the obtained results are interpreted physically whether or not the model gives reasonable answers. If a model is not accurate enough, we try to identify the sources of the shortcomings. It may happen that we need a new formulation, new mathematical manipulation and hence a new evaluation. Thus mathematical modelling can be a cycle of the modelling process as shown in the flowchart given below: ",
