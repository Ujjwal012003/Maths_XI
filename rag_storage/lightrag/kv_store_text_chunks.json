HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In",

For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",

Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a).

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1,",

All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Also $\\mathrm{C} = \\{5\\}$ but $-5 \\in \\mathrm{D}$ , hence $\\mathrm{C} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{E}$ . Further, $\\mathrm{D} = \\{-5, 5\\}$ and $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , we find that, $\\mathrm{D} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ .

The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies.

If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A.

Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of $\\mathbf{T}$ include $\\sqrt{2}$ , $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\pi$ . \n\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are: \n\n1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of $R$ Let $a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ . Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in",

For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample",

Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$",

If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ .

These are called De Morgan's laws. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan. \n\nThe complement $\\mathrm{A}'$ of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A. \n\nSome Properties of Complement Sets \n\nThese laws can be verified by using Venn diagrams. \n\nEXERCISE 1.5 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{B} = \\{d,e,f,g\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathbf{C} = \\{a,c,e,g\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\mathrm{D} = \\{f,g,h,a\\}$ \n\n3.

These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.",

This is an example of a set defined using a predicate, where the condition for membership in the set is specified by the equation. The solution to this equation is $x = 5$, which means that the set C contains only one element, namely 5.\n\nMathematically, this equation can be interpreted as a statement about the existence of a root of the linear polynomial $x - 5$. In other words, it asserts that there exists a value of x such that when substituted into the polynomial, the result is zero. This is a fundamental concept in algebra and has far-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics.\n\nIn the context of set theory, this equation illustrates the idea of defining a set using a condition or predicate. The set C is defined as the collection of all values of x that satisfy the given equation, which can be thought of as a filter or a sieve that selects certain elements from the universe of discourse (in this case, the real numbers).\n\nThe significance of this equation lies in its connection to other mathematical concepts, such as linear equations, polynomial roots, and set theory. It also highlights the importance of precise language and notation in mathematics, as the use of set-builder notation ($\\{x: \\text{condition}\\}$) allows for a clear and concise definition of the set C.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, this equation has implications in various fields, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and computer science.

This is denoted by the symbol ⊂. The equation states that for any element a in A, it implies that a is also in B. This definition is crucial in understanding the relationships between sets and their elements.\n\n    In this context, the variables A and B represent sets, while a represents an arbitrary element of set A. The implication operator (⇒) indicates that if a is an element of A, then it must also be an element of B for A to be considered a subset of B.\n\n    This equation has significant implications in various mathematical disciplines, including set theory, algebra, and topology. It provides the foundation for understanding concepts such as proper subsets, supersets, and equal sets.\n\n    The relationship between this equation and other mathematical concepts is evident in the context of subset relationships. For instance, if A ⊂ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, and B is a superset of A.\n\n    In practical applications, understanding subset relationships is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It enables the identification of patterns, relationships, and structures within complex datasets and systems.\n\n    The equation's significance extends beyond mathematical theory to real-world problems. For example, in database design, understanding subset relationships helps in optimizing data storage and retrieval processes. In machine learning, it aids in identifying relevant features and relationships between variables.\n\n    Overall, the given equation is a fundamental concept in set theory that has far-reaching implications in various mathematical disciplines and practical applications.",

The complement of a set is defined as the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. In this case, the universal set U consists of all prime numbers and set A consists of all prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Therefore, the complement of A with respect to U is the set of all prime numbers that are divisors of 42. The equation states that the complement of A is equal to {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which means that these five prime numbers are the only elements in U that do not belong to A.

Specifically, it states that the complement of the union of two sets A and B is equal to the intersection of their complements, i.e., (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'. This equation can be interpreted as follows: if we take the complement of a set A and the complement of another set B, and then find their intersection, it will result in the same set as taking the union of A and B and finding its complement. In other words, this law allows us to switch between the operations of union and intersection when dealing with complements of sets.",

The diagram consists of three overlapping circles representing the sets A, B, and X. Set A intersects with set X at point A ∩ X = φ, while set B also intersects with set X at point B ∩ X = φ. However, when considering the union of sets A and X (A ∪ X) and the union of sets B and X (B ∪ X), it is shown that these unions are equal. The diagram illustrates this equality by overlapping the circles representing sets A and B with set X. This visual representation supports the mathematical proof provided in the surrounding text, which aims to show that if A ∩ X = B ∩ X = φ and A ∪ X = B ∪ X for some set X, then A = B.\n\nThe diagram is drawn in a simple yet clear style, with each circle labeled accordingly. The colors used are standard mathematical notation colors, with black representing the sets and white representing the background. The lighting is neutral, providing no distractions from the visual representation of the sets.\n\nIn terms of technical details, the diagram appears to be hand-drawn or created using a simple drawing tool",

    "content": "RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. - BERTHELOT \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nMuch of mathematics is about finding a pattern - a recognisable link between quantities that change. In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The \n\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. \n\n2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets \n\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e., \n\nwhere $b, c$ and $s$ represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively. \n\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets? \n\nProceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below: \n\n(red, $b$ ), (red, $c$ ), (red, $s$ ), (blue, $b$ ), (blue, $c$ ), (blue, $s$ ). \n\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). \n\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ is a pair of elements written in small \n\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., $(p,q), p \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $q \\in \\mathrm{Q}$ . This leads to the following definition: \n\nDefinition 1 Given two non-empty sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . The cartesian product $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ , i.e., \n\nIf either $\\mathrm{P}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the null set, then $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ will also be empty set, i.e., $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\phi$ \n\nFrom the illustration given above we note that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(\\mathrm{red},b),(\\mathrm{red},c),(\\mathrm{red},s),(\\mathrm{blue},b),(\\mathrm{blue},c),(\\mathrm{blue},s)\\} .$ \n\nAgain, consider the two sets: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{\\mathrm{DL}, \\mathrm{MP}, \\mathrm{KA}\\}$ , where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{01,02,03\\}$ representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP",

This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL). \n\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and \n\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position $(a_{1}, b_{2})$ will be distinct from the point in the position $(b_{2}, a_{1})$ . \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal. \n\nExample 1 If $(x + 1, y - 2) = (3, 1)$ , find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal. \n\nTherefore $x + 1 = 3$ and $y - 2 = 1$ \n\nSolving we get $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ . \n\nExample 2 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{r\\}$ , form the sets $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nAre these two products equal? \n\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product, \n\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair $(a, r)$ is not equal to the pair $(r, a)$ , we conclude that $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} \\neq \\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nHowever, the number of elements in each set will be the same. \n\nExample 3 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3,4\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{4,5,6\\}$ .

We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as 'map' or 'mapping' used to denote a function. \n\nDefinition 5 A relation $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if every element of set $A$ has one and only one image in set $B$ . \n\nIn other words, a function $f$ is a relation from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ such that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and no two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element. \n\nIf $f$ is a function from A to B and $(a, b) \\in f$ , then $f(a) = b$ , where $b$ is called the image of $a$ under $f$ and $a$ is called the preimage of $b$ under $f$ . \n\nThe function $f$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ is denoted by $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image. \n\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and the relation $\\mathbf{R}$ be defined on $\\mathbf{N}$ such that $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}\\}$ . \n\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function? \n\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N. The range is the set of even natural numbers. \n\nSince every natural number $n$ has one and only one image, this relation is a function. \n\nExample 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not? \n\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function. \n\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a real function. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers.

He considered a function in terms of \"mathematical job\" – the \"employee\" being just a curve. \n\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval. \n\nFunction is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: \"The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities\".",

The Cartesian product is a fundamental concept in set theory that describes the set of all ordered pairs formed by taking one element from each of the two sets. In this context, set A consists of two elements: red and blue, representing colors, while set B comprises three elements: b, c, and s, representing specific objects (bag, coat, and shirt).

This concept is crucial in mathematics as it enables the description of relationships between sets and their elements, which is essential for various mathematical operations and functions.\n\nThe equation also highlights the importance of order in forming ordered pairs. For instance, the pair $(red,b)$ is distinct from $(b, red)$. This distinction is critical in understanding the Cartesian product's role in defining functions, as it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity and another.\n\nFurthermore, the equation illustrates the application domain of the Cartesian product in real-world scenarios. In this case, the ordered pairs can represent colored objects, emphasizing the practical significance of set theory in describing relationships between sets and their elements.\n\nThe equation's relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context is that it builds upon the definition of an ordered pair and introduces the concept of the Cartesian product as a means of linking pairs of objects from two sets.

In this specific case, A × B is defined as {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. This means that the elements of set A are paired with the elements of set B to form ordered pairs.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted in terms of relations and functions. Since A × B represents a relation from set A to set B, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. The given relation R = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} can be seen as a specific instance of this relation.\n\nIn terms of functions, the equation implies that there exists a function f from set A to set B such that f(1) = 3 and f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3 and f(2) = 4. However, since no two distinct ordered pairs in f have the same first element, this relation does not satisfy the definition of a function.\n\nThe equation's significance lies in its representation of the Cartesian product and relations between sets. It highlights the importance of understanding the properties of relations and functions in mathematics, particularly in the context of set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of mathematical operations and functions used, the equation involves the Cartesian product operation (×) and the concept of relations and functions. The equation also relies on the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation.\n\nThe application domain and context based on surrounding material are set theory and abstract algebra. The equation is relevant to understanding the properties of relations and functions in these areas.\n\nIn terms of physical or theoretical significance, the equation represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has numerous applications in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and physics.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context includes the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation, as well as the concept of functions. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of practical applications or use cases, the equation has implications for understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science, as well as modeling real-world phenomena in physics and engineering.\n\nThe equation's significance within the broader framework is that it represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has far-reaching implications for various fields.

The result is another function, (f + g), which maps each element x in X to the sum of the corresponding values of f(x) and g(x). This operation is fundamental in the algebra of real functions, enabling the combination of different functions to create new ones.\n\n    In this context, the equation highlights the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The addition of two functions is defined element-wise, meaning that for each x in X, the value of (f + g)(x) is obtained by adding the values of f(x) and g(x). This approach allows for the creation of new functions from existing ones, which is essential in various mathematical applications.\n\n    The equation's significance extends to the broader discussion on real functions. It demonstrates how different operations can be performed on functions, enabling the manipulation and combination of functions to solve problems or model real-world phenomena. The concept of pointwise addition is crucial in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and functional equations.\n\n    In practical applications, this equation has implications for various fields, such as signal processing, control theory, and optimization. For instance, the sum of two functions can represent the combination of different signals or the aggregation of multiple variables in a system.

The concept of linear functions is also relevant here, as f(x) = mx + c is an example of a linear function.\n\nPractical applications of these equations include modeling real-world phenomena, solving optimization problems, and analyzing data. For instance, in economics, the sum of two functions representing different economic variables can be used to model economic growth or inflation.\n\nThe equation (f - g)(x) = √x - x also has practical significance, as it represents the difference between two functions. This concept is crucial in various fields, including physics and engineering, where the difference between two physical quantities can be used to model real-world phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, these equations demonstrate the fundamental concepts of pointwise operations on real-valued functions and their applications in various fields.

The result is a new function that combines the properties of both f and g. Additionally, the quotient of f by g, denoted as (f/g)(x), is also provided. This equation demonstrates the application of pointwise multiplication and division in real functions.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation involve understanding the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The product (f*g)(x) = √x * x results in a new function that can be simplified to x^(3/2). Similarly, the quotient (f/g)(x) = √x / x simplifies to x^(-1/2), which is valid for x ≠ 0.\n\nThe variables and their definitions are as follows: f(x) represents the square root of x, g(x) represents x itself, and the result of the product or quotient operation depends on these functions. The mathematical operations used include multiplication (pointwise) and division (pointwise).\n\nIn the context of real functions, this equation is significant because it illustrates how different pointwise operations can be applied to combine functions. This concept is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, control systems, and data analysis.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the surrounding material involves understanding the properties of real functions, including their domains, ranges, and pointwise operations. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on algebraic operations with real functions, which is a fundamental topic in mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include solving problems involving function composition, signal processing, and control systems. For instance, understanding how to combine functions through pointwise multiplication and division can help in designing filters, controllers, or other systems that rely on mathematical modeling.\n\nThe broader discussion or framework involves the study of real functions, their properties, and operations. This equation is a specific example of applying these concepts to solve problems and understand the behavior of complex systems.",

The equation states that f(-2) equals 1 minus (-2), which simplifies to 3. This implies that when the input value is -2, the output of the function f is 3.\n\nIn the context of the surrounding material, this equation is likely related to Example 22, where a piecewise-defined function f(x) is introduced. The function f(x) has two different definitions depending on whether x is less than or greater than 0. For x < 0, f(x) = 1 - x.\n\nThe given equation can be seen as an application of this definition to the specific input value x = -2. By substituting x = -2 into the function f(x), we obtain f(-2) = 1 - (-2), which indeed equals 3.\n\nMathematically, this equation involves basic arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction. The use of parentheses is also crucial in ensuring that the correct order of operations is followed.\n\nIn terms of mathematical concepts, this equation relates to the idea of function evaluation, where a specific input value is plugged into a function to obtain an output value. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and has numerous applications in various fields, including science, engineering, and economics.\n\nPractically, understanding how to evaluate functions at specific points is essential for solving problems in calculus, algebra, and other areas of mathematics. It also has implications for real-world applications, such as modeling population growth, optimizing systems, or predicting outcomes based on given inputs.\n\nIn the broader context of the discussion, this equation contributes to a deeper understanding of function notation, evaluation, and application. It highlights the importance of carefully defining functions and evaluating them at specific points to obtain meaningful results.",

This is an example of a relation between two sets, specifically the set of real numbers. The equation defines a subset of the Cartesian product R × R, which includes all possible ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y ∈ R.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation are that it describes a collection of points in the plane, where each point is an ordered pair of real numbers. This relation can be thought of as a set of rules or constraints on the values of x and y, defining which pairs are included in the relation.\n\nIn the context of functions, this equation represents a relation between two sets, but it does not necessarily define a function. A function requires that each input value (x) corresponds to exactly one output value (y). In contrast, this relation allows for multiple output values for a given input value.\n\nThe variables x and y are defined as real numbers, which means they can take on any value in the set of real numbers. The mathematical operations used in this equation are none, as it simply defines a set of ordered pairs.\n\nIn terms of application domain and context, this equation is relevant to the study of relations and functions in mathematics. It provides a fundamental example of how relations can be defined between sets, and how these relations can be analyzed and interpreted.\n\nThe physical or theoretical significance of this equation lies in its ability to describe complex relationships between variables. In real-world applications, such as physics, engineering, or economics, relations like this one can be used to model and analyze systems, identify patterns, and make predictions.\n\nIn terms of relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context, this equation is closely related to the concept of functions, which are a special type of relation where each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. The equation also touches on the idea of relations between sets, which is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include modeling real-world systems, analyzing data, and making predictions. For example, in physics, this equation could be used to describe the relationship between position and velocity of an object, while in economics, it could be used to model the relationship between supply and demand.\n\nFinally, the equation relates to the broader discussion or framework by providing a fundamental example of how relations can be defined and analyzed.
