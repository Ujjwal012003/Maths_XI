HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In",

For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",

Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a).

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1,",

All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Also $\\mathrm{C} = \\{5\\}$ but $-5 \\in \\mathrm{D}$ , hence $\\mathrm{C} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{E}$ . Further, $\\mathrm{D} = \\{-5, 5\\}$ and $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , we find that, $\\mathrm{D} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ .

The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies.

If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A.

Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of $\\mathbf{T}$ include $\\sqrt{2}$ , $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\pi$ . \n\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are: \n\n1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of $R$ Let $a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ . Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in",

For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample",

Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$",

If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ .

These are called De Morgan's laws. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan. \n\nThe complement $\\mathrm{A}'$ of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A. \n\nSome Properties of Complement Sets \n\nThese laws can be verified by using Venn diagrams. \n\nEXERCISE 1.5 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{B} = \\{d,e,f,g\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathbf{C} = \\{a,c,e,g\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\mathrm{D} = \\{f,g,h,a\\}$ \n\n3.

These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.",

This is an example of a set defined using a predicate, where the condition for membership in the set is specified by the equation. The solution to this equation is $x = 5$, which means that the set C contains only one element, namely 5.\n\nMathematically, this equation can be interpreted as a statement about the existence of a root of the linear polynomial $x - 5$. In other words, it asserts that there exists a value of x such that when substituted into the polynomial, the result is zero. This is a fundamental concept in algebra and has far-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics.\n\nIn the context of set theory, this equation illustrates the idea of defining a set using a condition or predicate. The set C is defined as the collection of all values of x that satisfy the given equation, which can be thought of as a filter or a sieve that selects certain elements from the universe of discourse (in this case, the real numbers).\n\nThe significance of this equation lies in its connection to other mathematical concepts, such as linear equations, polynomial roots, and set theory. It also highlights the importance of precise language and notation in mathematics, as the use of set-builder notation ($\\{x: \\text{condition}\\}$) allows for a clear and concise definition of the set C.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, this equation has implications in various fields, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and computer science.

This is denoted by the symbol ⊂. The equation states that for any element a in A, it implies that a is also in B. This definition is crucial in understanding the relationships between sets and their elements.\n\n    In this context, the variables A and B represent sets, while a represents an arbitrary element of set A. The implication operator (⇒) indicates that if a is an element of A, then it must also be an element of B for A to be considered a subset of B.\n\n    This equation has significant implications in various mathematical disciplines, including set theory, algebra, and topology. It provides the foundation for understanding concepts such as proper subsets, supersets, and equal sets.\n\n    The relationship between this equation and other mathematical concepts is evident in the context of subset relationships. For instance, if A ⊂ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, and B is a superset of A.\n\n    In practical applications, understanding subset relationships is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It enables the identification of patterns, relationships, and structures within complex datasets and systems.\n\n    The equation's significance extends beyond mathematical theory to real-world problems. For example, in database design, understanding subset relationships helps in optimizing data storage and retrieval processes. In machine learning, it aids in identifying relevant features and relationships between variables.\n\n    Overall, the given equation is a fundamental concept in set theory that has far-reaching implications in various mathematical disciplines and practical applications.",

The complement of a set is defined as the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. In this case, the universal set U consists of all prime numbers and set A consists of all prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Therefore, the complement of A with respect to U is the set of all prime numbers that are divisors of 42. The equation states that the complement of A is equal to {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which means that these five prime numbers are the only elements in U that do not belong to A.

Specifically, it states that the complement of the union of two sets A and B is equal to the intersection of their complements, i.e., (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'. This equation can be interpreted as follows: if we take the complement of a set A and the complement of another set B, and then find their intersection, it will result in the same set as taking the union of A and B and finding its complement. In other words, this law allows us to switch between the operations of union and intersection when dealing with complements of sets.",

The diagram consists of three overlapping circles representing the sets A, B, and X. Set A intersects with set X at point A ∩ X = φ, while set B also intersects with set X at point B ∩ X = φ. However, when considering the union of sets A and X (A ∪ X) and the union of sets B and X (B ∪ X), it is shown that these unions are equal. The diagram illustrates this equality by overlapping the circles representing sets A and B with set X. This visual representation supports the mathematical proof provided in the surrounding text, which aims to show that if A ∩ X = B ∩ X = φ and A ∪ X = B ∪ X for some set X, then A = B.\n\nThe diagram is drawn in a simple yet clear style, with each circle labeled accordingly. The colors used are standard mathematical notation colors, with black representing the sets and white representing the background. The lighting is neutral, providing no distractions from the visual representation of the sets.\n\nIn terms of technical details, the diagram appears to be hand-drawn or created using a simple drawing tool",
