HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In",

For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",

Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a).

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1,",

All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Also $\\mathrm{C} = \\{5\\}$ but $-5 \\in \\mathrm{D}$ , hence $\\mathrm{C} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{E}$ . Further, $\\mathrm{D} = \\{-5, 5\\}$ and $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , we find that, $\\mathrm{D} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ .

The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies.

If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A.

Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of $\\mathbf{T}$ include $\\sqrt{2}$ , $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\pi$ . \n\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are: \n\n1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of $R$ Let $a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ . Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in",

For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample",

Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$",

If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ .

These are called De Morgan's laws. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan. \n\nThe complement $\\mathrm{A}'$ of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A. \n\nSome Properties of Complement Sets \n\nThese laws can be verified by using Venn diagrams. \n\nEXERCISE 1.5 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{B} = \\{d,e,f,g\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathbf{C} = \\{a,c,e,g\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\mathrm{D} = \\{f,g,h,a\\}$ \n\n3.

These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.",

This is an example of a set defined using a predicate, where the condition for membership in the set is specified by the equation. The solution to this equation is $x = 5$, which means that the set C contains only one element, namely 5.\n\nMathematically, this equation can be interpreted as a statement about the existence of a root of the linear polynomial $x - 5$. In other words, it asserts that there exists a value of x such that when substituted into the polynomial, the result is zero. This is a fundamental concept in algebra and has far-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics.\n\nIn the context of set theory, this equation illustrates the idea of defining a set using a condition or predicate. The set C is defined as the collection of all values of x that satisfy the given equation, which can be thought of as a filter or a sieve that selects certain elements from the universe of discourse (in this case, the real numbers).\n\nThe significance of this equation lies in its connection to other mathematical concepts, such as linear equations, polynomial roots, and set theory. It also highlights the importance of precise language and notation in mathematics, as the use of set-builder notation ($\\{x: \\text{condition}\\}$) allows for a clear and concise definition of the set C.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, this equation has implications in various fields, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and computer science.

This is denoted by the symbol ⊂. The equation states that for any element a in A, it implies that a is also in B. This definition is crucial in understanding the relationships between sets and their elements.\n\n    In this context, the variables A and B represent sets, while a represents an arbitrary element of set A. The implication operator (⇒) indicates that if a is an element of A, then it must also be an element of B for A to be considered a subset of B.\n\n    This equation has significant implications in various mathematical disciplines, including set theory, algebra, and topology. It provides the foundation for understanding concepts such as proper subsets, supersets, and equal sets.\n\n    The relationship between this equation and other mathematical concepts is evident in the context of subset relationships. For instance, if A ⊂ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, and B is a superset of A.\n\n    In practical applications, understanding subset relationships is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It enables the identification of patterns, relationships, and structures within complex datasets and systems.\n\n    The equation's significance extends beyond mathematical theory to real-world problems. For example, in database design, understanding subset relationships helps in optimizing data storage and retrieval processes. In machine learning, it aids in identifying relevant features and relationships between variables.\n\n    Overall, the given equation is a fundamental concept in set theory that has far-reaching implications in various mathematical disciplines and practical applications.",

The complement of a set is defined as the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. In this case, the universal set U consists of all prime numbers and set A consists of all prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Therefore, the complement of A with respect to U is the set of all prime numbers that are divisors of 42. The equation states that the complement of A is equal to {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which means that these five prime numbers are the only elements in U that do not belong to A.

Specifically, it states that the complement of the union of two sets A and B is equal to the intersection of their complements, i.e., (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'. This equation can be interpreted as follows: if we take the complement of a set A and the complement of another set B, and then find their intersection, it will result in the same set as taking the union of A and B and finding its complement. In other words, this law allows us to switch between the operations of union and intersection when dealing with complements of sets.",

The diagram consists of three overlapping circles representing the sets A, B, and X. Set A intersects with set X at point A ∩ X = φ, while set B also intersects with set X at point B ∩ X = φ. However, when considering the union of sets A and X (A ∪ X) and the union of sets B and X (B ∪ X), it is shown that these unions are equal. The diagram illustrates this equality by overlapping the circles representing sets A and B with set X. This visual representation supports the mathematical proof provided in the surrounding text, which aims to show that if A ∩ X = B ∩ X = φ and A ∪ X = B ∪ X for some set X, then A = B.\n\nThe diagram is drawn in a simple yet clear style, with each circle labeled accordingly. The colors used are standard mathematical notation colors, with black representing the sets and white representing the background. The lighting is neutral, providing no distractions from the visual representation of the sets.\n\nIn terms of technical details, the diagram appears to be hand-drawn or created using a simple drawing tool",

    "content": "RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. - BERTHELOT \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nMuch of mathematics is about finding a pattern - a recognisable link between quantities that change. In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The \n\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. \n\n2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets \n\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e., \n\nwhere $b, c$ and $s$ represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively. \n\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets? \n\nProceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below: \n\n(red, $b$ ), (red, $c$ ), (red, $s$ ), (blue, $b$ ), (blue, $c$ ), (blue, $s$ ). \n\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). \n\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ is a pair of elements written in small \n\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., $(p,q), p \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $q \\in \\mathrm{Q}$ . This leads to the following definition: \n\nDefinition 1 Given two non-empty sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . The cartesian product $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ , i.e., \n\nIf either $\\mathrm{P}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the null set, then $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ will also be empty set, i.e., $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\phi$ \n\nFrom the illustration given above we note that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(\\mathrm{red},b),(\\mathrm{red},c),(\\mathrm{red},s),(\\mathrm{blue},b),(\\mathrm{blue},c),(\\mathrm{blue},s)\\} .$ \n\nAgain, consider the two sets: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{\\mathrm{DL}, \\mathrm{MP}, \\mathrm{KA}\\}$ , where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{01,02,03\\}$ representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP",

This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL). \n\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and \n\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position $(a_{1}, b_{2})$ will be distinct from the point in the position $(b_{2}, a_{1})$ . \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal. \n\nExample 1 If $(x + 1, y - 2) = (3, 1)$ , find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal. \n\nTherefore $x + 1 = 3$ and $y - 2 = 1$ \n\nSolving we get $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ . \n\nExample 2 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{r\\}$ , form the sets $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nAre these two products equal? \n\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product, \n\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair $(a, r)$ is not equal to the pair $(r, a)$ , we conclude that $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} \\neq \\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nHowever, the number of elements in each set will be the same. \n\nExample 3 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3,4\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{4,5,6\\}$ .

We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as 'map' or 'mapping' used to denote a function. \n\nDefinition 5 A relation $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if every element of set $A$ has one and only one image in set $B$ . \n\nIn other words, a function $f$ is a relation from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ such that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and no two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element. \n\nIf $f$ is a function from A to B and $(a, b) \\in f$ , then $f(a) = b$ , where $b$ is called the image of $a$ under $f$ and $a$ is called the preimage of $b$ under $f$ . \n\nThe function $f$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ is denoted by $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image. \n\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and the relation $\\mathbf{R}$ be defined on $\\mathbf{N}$ such that $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}\\}$ . \n\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function? \n\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N. The range is the set of even natural numbers. \n\nSince every natural number $n$ has one and only one image, this relation is a function. \n\nExample 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not? \n\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function. \n\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a real function. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers.

He considered a function in terms of \"mathematical job\" – the \"employee\" being just a curve. \n\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval. \n\nFunction is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: \"The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities\".",

The Cartesian product is a fundamental concept in set theory that describes the set of all ordered pairs formed by taking one element from each of the two sets. In this context, set A consists of two elements: red and blue, representing colors, while set B comprises three elements: b, c, and s, representing specific objects (bag, coat, and shirt).

This concept is crucial in mathematics as it enables the description of relationships between sets and their elements, which is essential for various mathematical operations and functions.\n\nThe equation also highlights the importance of order in forming ordered pairs. For instance, the pair $(red,b)$ is distinct from $(b, red)$. This distinction is critical in understanding the Cartesian product's role in defining functions, as it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity and another.\n\nFurthermore, the equation illustrates the application domain of the Cartesian product in real-world scenarios. In this case, the ordered pairs can represent colored objects, emphasizing the practical significance of set theory in describing relationships between sets and their elements.\n\nThe equation's relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context is that it builds upon the definition of an ordered pair and introduces the concept of the Cartesian product as a means of linking pairs of objects from two sets.

In this specific case, A × B is defined as {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. This means that the elements of set A are paired with the elements of set B to form ordered pairs.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted in terms of relations and functions. Since A × B represents a relation from set A to set B, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. The given relation R = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} can be seen as a specific instance of this relation.\n\nIn terms of functions, the equation implies that there exists a function f from set A to set B such that f(1) = 3 and f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3 and f(2) = 4. However, since no two distinct ordered pairs in f have the same first element, this relation does not satisfy the definition of a function.\n\nThe equation's significance lies in its representation of the Cartesian product and relations between sets. It highlights the importance of understanding the properties of relations and functions in mathematics, particularly in the context of set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of mathematical operations and functions used, the equation involves the Cartesian product operation (×) and the concept of relations and functions. The equation also relies on the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation.\n\nThe application domain and context based on surrounding material are set theory and abstract algebra. The equation is relevant to understanding the properties of relations and functions in these areas.\n\nIn terms of physical or theoretical significance, the equation represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has numerous applications in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and physics.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context includes the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation, as well as the concept of functions. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of practical applications or use cases, the equation has implications for understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science, as well as modeling real-world phenomena in physics and engineering.\n\nThe equation's significance within the broader framework is that it represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has far-reaching implications for various fields.

The result is another function, (f + g), which maps each element x in X to the sum of the corresponding values of f(x) and g(x). This operation is fundamental in the algebra of real functions, enabling the combination of different functions to create new ones.\n\n    In this context, the equation highlights the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The addition of two functions is defined element-wise, meaning that for each x in X, the value of (f + g)(x) is obtained by adding the values of f(x) and g(x). This approach allows for the creation of new functions from existing ones, which is essential in various mathematical applications.\n\n    The equation's significance extends to the broader discussion on real functions. It demonstrates how different operations can be performed on functions, enabling the manipulation and combination of functions to solve problems or model real-world phenomena. The concept of pointwise addition is crucial in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and functional equations.\n\n    In practical applications, this equation has implications for various fields, such as signal processing, control theory, and optimization. For instance, the sum of two functions can represent the combination of different signals or the aggregation of multiple variables in a system.

The concept of linear functions is also relevant here, as f(x) = mx + c is an example of a linear function.\n\nPractical applications of these equations include modeling real-world phenomena, solving optimization problems, and analyzing data. For instance, in economics, the sum of two functions representing different economic variables can be used to model economic growth or inflation.\n\nThe equation (f - g)(x) = √x - x also has practical significance, as it represents the difference between two functions. This concept is crucial in various fields, including physics and engineering, where the difference between two physical quantities can be used to model real-world phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, these equations demonstrate the fundamental concepts of pointwise operations on real-valued functions and their applications in various fields.

The result is a new function that combines the properties of both f and g. Additionally, the quotient of f by g, denoted as (f/g)(x), is also provided. This equation demonstrates the application of pointwise multiplication and division in real functions.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation involve understanding the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The product (f*g)(x) = √x * x results in a new function that can be simplified to x^(3/2). Similarly, the quotient (f/g)(x) = √x / x simplifies to x^(-1/2), which is valid for x ≠ 0.\n\nThe variables and their definitions are as follows: f(x) represents the square root of x, g(x) represents x itself, and the result of the product or quotient operation depends on these functions. The mathematical operations used include multiplication (pointwise) and division (pointwise).\n\nIn the context of real functions, this equation is significant because it illustrates how different pointwise operations can be applied to combine functions. This concept is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, control systems, and data analysis.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the surrounding material involves understanding the properties of real functions, including their domains, ranges, and pointwise operations. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on algebraic operations with real functions, which is a fundamental topic in mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include solving problems involving function composition, signal processing, and control systems. For instance, understanding how to combine functions through pointwise multiplication and division can help in designing filters, controllers, or other systems that rely on mathematical modeling.\n\nThe broader discussion or framework involves the study of real functions, their properties, and operations. This equation is a specific example of applying these concepts to solve problems and understand the behavior of complex systems.",

The equation states that f(-2) equals 1 minus (-2), which simplifies to 3. This implies that when the input value is -2, the output of the function f is 3.\n\nIn the context of the surrounding material, this equation is likely related to Example 22, where a piecewise-defined function f(x) is introduced. The function f(x) has two different definitions depending on whether x is less than or greater than 0. For x < 0, f(x) = 1 - x.\n\nThe given equation can be seen as an application of this definition to the specific input value x = -2. By substituting x = -2 into the function f(x), we obtain f(-2) = 1 - (-2), which indeed equals 3.\n\nMathematically, this equation involves basic arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction. The use of parentheses is also crucial in ensuring that the correct order of operations is followed.\n\nIn terms of mathematical concepts, this equation relates to the idea of function evaluation, where a specific input value is plugged into a function to obtain an output value. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and has numerous applications in various fields, including science, engineering, and economics.\n\nPractically, understanding how to evaluate functions at specific points is essential for solving problems in calculus, algebra, and other areas of mathematics. It also has implications for real-world applications, such as modeling population growth, optimizing systems, or predicting outcomes based on given inputs.\n\nIn the broader context of the discussion, this equation contributes to a deeper understanding of function notation, evaluation, and application. It highlights the importance of carefully defining functions and evaluating them at specific points to obtain meaningful results.",

This is an example of a relation between two sets, specifically the set of real numbers. The equation defines a subset of the Cartesian product R × R, which includes all possible ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y ∈ R.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation are that it describes a collection of points in the plane, where each point is an ordered pair of real numbers. This relation can be thought of as a set of rules or constraints on the values of x and y, defining which pairs are included in the relation.\n\nIn the context of functions, this equation represents a relation between two sets, but it does not necessarily define a function. A function requires that each input value (x) corresponds to exactly one output value (y). In contrast, this relation allows for multiple output values for a given input value.\n\nThe variables x and y are defined as real numbers, which means they can take on any value in the set of real numbers. The mathematical operations used in this equation are none, as it simply defines a set of ordered pairs.\n\nIn terms of application domain and context, this equation is relevant to the study of relations and functions in mathematics. It provides a fundamental example of how relations can be defined between sets, and how these relations can be analyzed and interpreted.\n\nThe physical or theoretical significance of this equation lies in its ability to describe complex relationships between variables. In real-world applications, such as physics, engineering, or economics, relations like this one can be used to model and analyze systems, identify patterns, and make predictions.\n\nIn terms of relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context, this equation is closely related to the concept of functions, which are a special type of relation where each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. The equation also touches on the idea of relations between sets, which is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include modeling real-world systems, analyzing data, and making predictions. For example, in physics, this equation could be used to describe the relationship between position and velocity of an object, while in economics, it could be used to model the relationship between supply and demand.\n\nFinally, the equation relates to the broader discussion or framework by providing a fundamental example of how relations can be defined and analyzed.

    "content": "TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS \n\nA mathematician knows how to solve a problem, he can not solve it. - MILNE \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words 'trigon' and 'metron' and it means 'measuring the sides of a triangle'. The subject was originally developed to solve geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a musical tone and in many other areas. \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right \n\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and study their properties. \n\n3.2 Angles \n\nAngle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is \n\ncalled the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation \n\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1). \n\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of rotation performed to get the terminal side from the initial side. There are several units for measuring angles. The definition of an angle \n\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as indicated in Fig 3.2. \n\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz. degree measure and radian measure. \n\n3.2.1 Degree measure If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is $\\left(\\frac{1}{360}\\right)^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as $1^{\\circ}$ . A degree is divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds. One sixtieth of a degree is called a minute, written as $1'$ , and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as $1''$ . Thus, $1^{\\circ} = 60'$ , $1' = 60''$ \n\nSome of the angles whose measures are $360^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ}, 420^{\\circ}, -30^{\\circ}, -420^{\\circ}$ are shown in Fig 3.3. \n\n3.2.2 Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig 3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, $-1$ radian, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian and $-1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian. \n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is $2\\pi$ . Thus, one",

The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, $-1$ radian, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian and $-1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian. \n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is $2\\pi$ . Thus, one complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian. \n\nMore generally, in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ will subtend an angle of 1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre. Since in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ subtends an angle whose measure is 1 radian, an arc of length $l$ will subtend an angle whose measure is $\\frac{l}{r}$ radian. Thus, if in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $l$ subtends an angle $\\theta$ radian at the centre, we have $\\theta = \\frac{l}{r}$ or $l = r\\theta$ . \n\n3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle. Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the real number zero, AP represents positive real number and AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real number will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can be considered as one and the same. \n\n3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre an angle whose radian measure is $2\\pi$ and its degree measure is $360^{\\circ}$ , it follows that \n\nThe above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value of $\\pi$ as $\\frac{22}{7}$ , we have \n\nAlso $1^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radian $= 0.01746$ radian approximately. \n\nThe relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles are given in the following table: \n\nNotational Convention \n\nSince angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention that whenever we write angle $\\theta^{\\circ}$ , we mean the angle whose degree measure is $\\theta$ and whenever we write angle $\\beta$ , we mean the angle whose radian measure is $\\beta$ . \n\nNote that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word 'radian' is frequently omitted. Thus, $\\pi = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 45^{\\circ}$ are written with the understanding that $\\pi$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ are radian measures. Thus, we can say that \n\nRadian measure $= \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\times$ Degree measure \n\nDegree measure $= \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\times$ Radian measure \n\nExample 1 Convert $40^{\\circ}20^{\\prime}$ into radian measure. \n\nSolution We know that $180^{\\circ} = \\pi$ rad",

We will now extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions. \n\nConsider a unit circle with centre at origin of the coordinate axes. Let $\\mathrm{P}(a,b)$ be any point on the circle with angle $\\mathrm{AOP} = x$ radian, i.e., length of arc $\\mathrm{AP} = x$ (Fig 3.6). \n\nWe define $\\cos x = a$ and $\\sin x = b$ Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{OMP}$ is a right triangle, we have \n\n$\\mathrm{OM}^2 +\\mathrm{MP}^2 = \\mathrm{OP}^2$ or $a^2 +b^2 = 1$ Thus, for every point on the unit circle, we have \n\nSince one complete revolution subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian at the centre of the circle, $\\angle \\mathrm{AOB} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ \n\n$\\angle \\mathrm{AOC} = \\pi$ and $\\angle \\mathrm{AOD} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ . All angles which are integral multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ are called quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively, $(1,0)$ , $(0,1)$ , $(-1,0)$ and $(0, -1)$ . Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have \n\nNow, if we take one complete revolution from the point $\\mathrm{P}$ , we again come back to same point $\\mathrm{P}$ . Thus, we also observe that if $x$ increases (or decreases) by any integral multiple of $2\\pi$ , the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus, \n\nFurther, $\\sin x = 0$ , if $x = 0, \\pm \\pi, \\pm 2\\pi, \\pm 3\\pi, \\ldots$ , i.e., when $x$ is an integral multiple of $\\pi$ and $\\cos x = 0$ , if $x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots$ i.e., $\\cos x$ vanishes when $x$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ .

Similarly, $\\cos x$ is positive for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , negative for $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and also positive for $\\frac{3\\pi}{2} < x < 2\\pi$ . Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table. \n\n3.3.2 Domain and range of trigonometric functions From the definition of sine and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further, we observe that for each real number $x$ , \n\nThus, domain of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\cos x$ is the set of all real numbers and range is the interval $[-1, 1]$ , i.e., $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$ . \n\nSince $\\operatorname{cosec} x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$ , the domain of $y = \\operatorname{cosec} x$",

In fact, we have the following table: \n\nRemark In the above table, the statement $\\tan x$ increases from 0 to $\\infty$ (infinity) for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ simply means that $\\tan x$ increases as $x$ increases for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and \n\nassumes arbitrarily large positive values as $x$ approaches to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ .

Let $x$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_1$ and $y$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Then $(x + y)$ is the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Also let $(-y)$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_3$ . Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4$ will have the coordinates $\\mathrm{P}_1(\\cos x, \\sin x), \\mathrm{P}_2[\\cos (x + y), \\sin (x + y)], \\mathrm{P}_3[\\cos (-y), \\sin (-y)]$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4(1, 0)$ (Fig 3.14). \n\nConsider the triangles $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{OP}_4$ . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ are equal. By using distance formula, we get \n\nAlso, $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2 = [1 - \\cos (x + y)]^2 + [0 - \\sin (x + y)]^2$ \n\nSince $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ , we have $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3^2 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2$ . \n\nTherefore, $2 - 2$ (cos $x$ cos $y - \\sin x$ sin $y) = 2 - 2$ cos $(x + y)$ \n\nHence $\\cos (x + y) = \\cos x\\cos y - \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\n4. $\\cos (x - y) = \\cos x\\cos y + \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\nReplacing $y$ by $-y$ in identity 3, we get \n\n5. $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\sin x$ \n\nIf we replace $x$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $y$ by $x$ in Identity (4), we get \n\n6. $\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\cos x$ \n\nUsing the Identity 5, we have \n\n7. $\\sin (x + y) = \\sin x\\cos y + \\cos x\\sin y$ \n\nWe know that \n\n8",

The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world. \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of mathematics. \n\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than $90^{\\circ}$ . A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa (period) contains a proof for the expansion of $\\sin (A + B)$ . Exact expression for sines or cosines of $18^{\\circ}$ , $36^{\\circ}$ , $54^{\\circ}$ , $72^{\\circ}$ , etc., are given by Bhaskara II. \n\nThe symbols $\\sin^{-1}x$ , $\\cos^{-1}x$ , etc., for arc $\\sin x$ , arc $\\cos x$ , etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: \n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.",

The composition centers on a coordinate plane with a horizontal initial side represented by a ray extending from a vertex point at the origin. The vertex is clearly marked as the point of rotation. From this vertex, a second ray, the terminal side, is shown rotated anticlockwise from the initial side, forming an angle between the two rays. The angle is labeled with a curved arc between the initial and terminal sides, indicating the measure of the positive angle. The rays and angle arc are drawn in black lines on a white background, ensuring clarity and focus on the geometric elements. The image is simple and schematic, designed to visually explain the definition of a positive angle as an anticlockwise rotation from the initial side to the terminal side. The diagram aligns with the surrounding textual content that introduces angles, their measurement, and the distinction between positive and negative angles based on rotation direction. The visual style is minimalistic and educational, typical of mathematical textbooks, emphasizing conceptual understanding without extraneous details or color distractions. There are no additional objects, people, or text within the image aside from the caption '(i)Positive angle' which reinforces the instructional purpose of the figure.",

The diagram features a circle centered at point O, labeled as the origin or center of the circle. A radius OA is drawn from the center O to a point A on the circumference, representing the initial side of an angle. Another radius OB extends from O to a point B on the circumference, representing the terminal side of the angle. The arc length AB on the circle is highlighted, indicating the portion of the circumference subtended by the angle at the center O. The angle formed between OA and OB at O is marked, likely denoted as θ (theta), representing the radian measure of the angle. The circle is a unit circle, meaning its radius is 1 unit, which is crucial for defining the radian measure as the length of the arc subtended by the angle. The diagram uses clear, simple lines with black strokes on a white background, typical of educational mathematical illustrations. The points O, A, and B are labeled with capital letters, and the arc AB is often marked with a curved line or arc symbol to emphasize the length corresponding to the radian measure. The layout is clean and uncluttered, focusing on the relationship between the radius, arc length, and angle measure. This visual directly supports the textual explanation of radian measure, showing how an arc length equal to the radius corresponds to an angle of 1 radian. The image is integral to understanding the transition from degree measure to radian measure and the geometric interpretation of radians on the unit circle.",

The circle is drawn with a black outline on a white background. There are four subfigures labeled (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), each illustrating different angles measured in radians. In each subfigure, the initial side of the angle is represented by the line segment OA, which is fixed along the positive x-axis. The terminal side of the angle is represented by the line segment OB, which rotates around the center O. The angles shown are 1 radian, -1 radian, 1.5 radians (1 1/2), and -1.5 radians (-1 1/2) respectively. The positive angles (1 and 1.5 radians) are shown as counterclockwise rotations from OA to OB, while the negative angles (-1 and -1.5 radians) are shown as clockwise rotations. Each subfigure includes an arc between OA and OB, highlighted to indicate the length of the arc corresponding to the radian measure. The arc length is visually proportional to the radian value, demonstrating the concept that the radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. The points O, A, and B are marked clearly, with O at the center, A on the circumference at the positive x-axis, and B on the circumference at the terminal side of the angle. The image uses simple line drawings with black lines and no additional colors or shading. The layout is clean and schematic, designed to visually explain the radian measure concept as described in the surrounding text. The image directly supports the explanation of radian measure by showing how different radian values correspond to arcs on the unit circle, including positive and negative angles, reinforcing the mathematical definitions and relationships discussed in the text.",

The formula used is r = l / θ, which arises from the definition of radian measure where the length of an arc intercepted by a central angle θ on a circle of radius r is l = rθ. Here, the arc length l is 37.4 cm, and the central angle θ is 60 degrees, converted to radians as θ = (60π)/180 = π/3. Substituting these values, the radius is computed as r = (37.4 × 3) / π. Using the approximation π = 22/7, the expression is further simplified to r = (37.4 × 3 × 7) / 22, yielding approximately 35.7 cm. This calculation exemplifies the practical use of radian measure in relating linear and angular quantities in circular geometry. It also demonstrates the conversion between degrees and radians and the application of π approximations in computations.

Here, 'a' and 'b' denote the x- and y-coordinates, respectively, of a point P(a,b) on the unit circle centered at the origin, where the angle x (in radians) is the measure of the arc length from the positive x-axis to the point P. The equation asserts that the sum of the squares of the cosine and sine of any angle x is always unity, reflecting the radius of the unit circle. This identity arises from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by the radius (hypotenuse of length 1), and the projections on the x- and y-axes (legs of lengths |a| and |b|). The functions cos x and sin x are defined as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to angle x, extending the trigonometric ratios beyond acute angles to all real numbers. This equation is foundational in trigonometry, underpinning the periodicity and symmetry properties of sine and cosine functions, and is essential in solving trigonometric equations, analyzing waveforms, and modeling oscillatory phenomena. It connects geometric interpretations with algebraic identities and serves as a basis for defining other trigonometric functions and identities. In the broader context, it facilitates the extension of trigonometric concepts from right triangles to the unit circle framework, enabling the study of angles of any measure and the development of advanced mathematical and physical theories involving periodicity and harmonic motion.",

The circle is drawn with a solid black line, and the radius is 1 unit, consistent with the unit circle definition. Four key points on the circle are labeled: A at (1,0) on the positive x-axis, B at (0,1) on the positive y-axis, C at (-1,0) on the negative x-axis, and D at (0,-1) on the negative y-axis. A point P with coordinates (a,b) lies on the circumference of the circle in the first quadrant, indicating that both a and b are positive and satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = 1. The angle AOP, denoted as x radians, is shown as the angle subtended at the origin O between the positive x-axis (line OA) and the radius OP. The arc length AP corresponds to the radian measure x, visually linking the angle to the arc on the circle. A perpendicular line from point P drops down to the x-axis at point M, forming a right triangle OMP with right angle at M. This triangle illustrates the geometric basis for defining sine and cosine functions: OM equals a (cos x) and MP equals b (sin x). The image uses black lines and points with labels in black text on a white background, maintaining clarity and focus on the geometric relationships. The visual style is schematic and educational, designed to support the explanation of trigonometric functions in terms of the unit circle and radian measure. The image directly relates to the surrounding text, which discusses extending trigonometric ratios to any angle using radian measure, defining cosine and sine as the x and y coordinates of point P on the unit circle, and establishing the fundamental identity a^2 + b^2 = 1. The diagram effectively supports the conceptual transition from right triangle definitions to unit circle definitions of trigonometric functions.",

Here, x is a real variable representing an angle measured in radians. The cotangent function, cot x, is defined as the ratio of cosine to sine, cot x = cos x / sin x, and the secant function, sec x, is the reciprocal of cosine, sec x = 1 / cos x. The equation arises from the primary Pythagorean identity sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 by dividing through by sin^2 x, yielding 1 + cot^2 x = csc^2 x, and similarly by dividing through by cos^2 x, yielding 1 + tan^2 x = sec^2 x. This particular identity emphasizes the relationship between cotangent and secant, showing that the sum of 1 and the square of cotangent equals the square of secant. It is valid for all x where sine and cosine are nonzero to avoid division by zero. The identity is crucial in simplifying trigonometric expressions, solving equations, and analyzing periodic phenomena. Within the broader context of the unit circle and trigonometric function properties discussed, this identity complements the understanding of function values, signs in different quadrants, and the periodicity of trigonometric functions. It also underpins the derivation of other trigonometric identities and is widely used in calculus, physics, and engineering to model oscillatory behavior and waveforms.",

The circle is drawn with a black outline on a white background. The coordinate axes are clearly marked with the horizontal axis labeled as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis, both extending beyond the circle. Four key points on the circle are labeled: A at (1,0) on the positive x-axis, B at (0,1) on the positive y-axis, C at (-1,0) on the negative x-axis, and D at (0,-1) on the negative y-axis. These points correspond to the quadrantal angles 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 respectively. Another point P is marked on the circumference in the first quadrant, with coordinates (a,b), where both a and b are positive. A line segment OP is drawn from the origin to point P, forming an angle x with the positive x-axis. Additionally, a point Q is shown with coordinates (a,-b) in the fourth quadrant, reflecting point P across the x-axis, illustrating the relationship between angles x and -x. The image uses black lines and text for clarity, with no additional colors or shading. The visual style is schematic and mathematical, focusing on clarity and precision. The image supports the surrounding text by visually demonstrating the definitions and properties of sine and cosine functions on the unit circle, the concept of quadrantal angles, and the symmetry properties of trigonometric functions with respect to the x-axis. It effectively illustrates how the coordinates of points on the unit circle correspond to cosine and sine values of angles, and how these values change with angle sign inversion.",

Each cell describes the behavior of the function within the respective quadrant in terms of increasing or decreasing values and their ranges. For example, sin increases from 0 to 1 in the first quadrant and decreases from 1 to 0 in the second quadrant, reflecting its positive values in the first two quadrants and negative values in the last two. Cos decreases from 1 to 0 in the first quadrant and continues decreasing to -1 in the second quadrant, then increases back to 1 in the fourth quadrant, matching its sign changes across quadrants. Tan and cot show asymptotic behavior with values tending to infinity or negative infinity near quadrant boundaries, consistent with their undefined points at multiples of π/2. Sec and csc, being reciprocals of cos and sin respectively, exhibit ranges outside [-1,1] and show increasing or decreasing trends towards infinity or negative infinity in each quadrant. The table clearly illustrates the periodic and sign-changing nature of trigonometric functions across the four quadrants, supporting the textual explanation of domain, range, and sign behavior of these functions. It also visually confirms the increasing/decreasing trends and asymptotic limits discussed in the surrounding content, such as sin x increasing from 0 to 1 in the first quadrant and tan x increasing to infinity as x approaches π/2 from the left. The relationships between the functions, such as reciprocal identities (sec = 1/cos, csc = 1/sin) and complementary behavior of tan and cot, are implicitly supported by the mirrored increasing/decreasing patterns and range limits. This table is significant as it consolidates the quadrant-wise behavior of all six primary trigonometric functions, providing a comprehensive reference that complements the theoretical domain and range discussions and the sign analysis of trigonometric functions in the text.",

The graph is drawn on a Cartesian coordinate system with the horizontal axis labeled as 'x' and the vertical axis labeled as 'cosec x'. The x-axis is marked with key points at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π, each labeled clearly with their respective symbols. The y-axis includes numerical values ranging from -5 to 5, with horizontal grid lines aiding in visualizing the function's values. The graph of cosec x is depicted as a series of two distinct branches in each period, showing vertical asymptotes at points where sin x equals zero, specifically at x = 0, π, and 2π, where the function tends to infinity or negative infinity. The branches approach these asymptotes sharply, illustrating the function's behavior of assuming arbitrarily large positive or negative values near these points. The curve is colored in a solid blue line, contrasting against a white background with light gray grid lines. The graph visually confirms the textual explanation that cosec x decreases from -1 to negative infinity in the fourth quadrant and increases from 1 to positive infinity in the first quadrant, repeating this behavior every 2π interval. The image effectively supports the surrounding mathematical context by providing a visual representation of the cosecant function's periodicity, asymptotic behavior, and value ranges, complementing the detailed trigonometric function analysis and examples discussed on pages 11 and 13.",

The graph is plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled in radians, marked at key points 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π. The y-axis represents the values of cosec x, with numerical values indicated at -4, -2, 2, and 4. The graph shows vertical asymptotes at x = 0, π, and 2π, where the function tends to positive or negative infinity, consistent with the undefined values of cosec x at these points. Between these asymptotes, the curve exhibits two distinct branches: in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), the curve descends from positive infinity to 1, then rises again towards positive infinity as it approaches π from the left; in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2), the curve descends from negative infinity to -1, then rises back towards negative infinity as it approaches 2π from the left. The graph is drawn with a smooth blue curve, and the background is white with black axes and grid lines for clarity. The title or label 'Fig 3.13' is positioned near the graph, indicating its reference in the surrounding mathematical text. The graph visually supports the textual explanation of the behavior of cosec x, including its periodicity, asymptotic behavior, and values in different quadrants, as discussed in the surrounding content. The image is a technical mathematical plot used to illustrate the properties of the cosecant function in a trigonometry context.",

Specifically, cosine is periodic with period 360°, so adding multiples of 360° to the angle does not change its value. Here, -1710° + 1800° = 90°, and thus cos(-1710°) = cos(90°) = 0. The variables involved are angles measured in degrees, and the function used is the cosine trigonometric function. This equation exemplifies the fundamental periodicity property of trigonometric functions, which is crucial in simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving problems involving large or negative angles. It relates directly to the surrounding context where the periodicity of sine and cosine functions is used to find values of trigonometric functions for angles outside the standard interval [0°, 360°]. The physical or theoretical significance lies in the understanding of wave behavior, oscillations, and rotations where angles can be normalized within a principal range. This concept is foundational in trigonometry, signal processing, and physics.

The diagram is centered on a unit circle with its center at the origin O of a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle is drawn with a bold black outline, and the coordinate axes are marked with arrows indicating positive directions. Four points labeled P1, P2, P3, and P4 lie on the circumference of the circle. Point P4 is positioned at (1, 0) on the positive x-axis, serving as the reference point. Point P1 corresponds to the angle x, located counterclockwise from P4, with coordinates (cos x, sin x). Point P2 represents the angle (x + y), further counterclockwise from P1, with coordinates (cos(x + y), sin(x + y)). Point P3 corresponds to the angle -y, clockwise from P4, with coordinates (cos(-y), sin(-y)). The points are connected by line segments forming triangles P1OP3 and P2OP4, which are highlighted to show their congruence. The diagram uses thin black lines for the circle and axes, and slightly thicker lines for the triangles and chords to emphasize the geometric relationships. The angles x, y, and (x + y) are indicated by arcs near the origin, with small arrowheads showing the direction of measurement. The layout visually supports the explanation in the surrounding text by demonstrating how the distances and coordinates relate to the trigonometric identity. The image uses a clean, mathematical style typical of textbook diagrams, with clear labels and no extraneous colors or shading. The lighting is uniform and flat, consistent with a line drawing. This visual aids in understanding the derivation of the cosine sum formula by showing the geometric interpretation on the unit circle and the congruence of triangles involved in the proof.",

Specifically, P1 has coordinates (cos x, sin x) and P3 has coordinates (cos(-y), sin(-y)), which simplifies to (cos y, -sin y) due to the even and odd properties of cosine and sine respectively. The equation calculates the Euclidean distance squared between these points using the distance formula: (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2. The algebraic expansion involves squaring the differences of cosine and sine components, leading to terms involving cos²x, cos²y, sin²x, sin²y, and cross terms -2 cos x cos y and +2 sin x sin y. Utilizing the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, the sum of squared cosine and sine terms simplifies to 2. The final expression, 2 - 2(cos x cos y - sin x sin y), reveals a direct connection to the cosine of the sum of angles identity, since cos(x + y) = cos x cos y - sin x sin y. Thus, the squared distance between P1 and P3 is expressed as 2 - 2 cos(x + y), linking geometric distance on the unit circle to trigonometric sum formulas. This equation is derived in the context of proving the cosine addition formula using geometric arguments involving congruent triangles and the unit circle. It highlights the interplay between geometry and trigonometry, demonstrating how distances correspond to trigonometric identities. The variables x and y represent angles subtended at the origin, and the points correspond to positions on the unit circle. The equation uses fundamental trigonometric functions (sine and cosine), their parity properties, and the Pythagorean identity. This analysis is foundational in trigonometry, underpinning the derivation of sum and difference formulas, which have broad applications in physics, engineering, signal processing, and any domain involving periodic phenomena. It also illustrates the geometric interpretation of trigonometric identities, reinforcing the conceptual understanding of angle addition formulas within the broader framework of trigonometric functions and their properties.",

The left-hand side (L.H.S.) starts as a combination of products of cosines: 2 cos(2x) cos(x/2) and 2 cos(9x/2) cos(3x). Using the product-to-sum formulas, these products are converted into sums of cosines with arguments that are sums and differences of the original angles. Specifically, the identity cos A cos B = (1/2)[cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] is applied. After simplification, terms cancel out, leaving a difference of cosines. This difference is then transformed into a product of sines using the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin((A+B)/2) sin((A-B)/2). The final expression is a product of sine functions: sin(5x) sin(5x/2), which matches the right-hand side (R.H.S.) of the equation, confirming the identity. Variables: x is a real variable, typically representing an angle measured in radians. Mathematical operations include multiplication, addition, subtraction, and the use of trigonometric functions cosine and sine. The equation is situated within the context of trigonometric identities and transformations, useful in simplifying expressions involving multiple angles. The theoretical significance lies in demonstrating the equivalence of complex trigonometric expressions through standard identities, facilitating problem-solving in trigonometry, Fourier analysis, and signal processing.

Specifically, it proves that the sum \\( \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 \\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\cos^2 \\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\). The proof uses the double-angle identity for cosine squared, \\( \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} \\), to rewrite each term. The variables are: \\( x \\), a real variable representing an angle in radians; the constants \\( \\pi \\) and fractions thereof represent fixed angular shifts. The operations include cosine function, addition, multiplication, and the use of the cosine addition formula \\( \\cos(a + b) + \\cos(a - b) = 2 \\cos a \\cos b \\). The identity leverages the symmetry and periodicity of cosine to simplify the sum to a constant value \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), independent of \\( x \\). This result is significant in trigonometry and Fourier analysis, illustrating how shifted cosine squares sum to a constant, reflecting orthogonality and energy distribution in harmonic components. It relates to other trigonometric identities and is useful in signal processing, physics (wave superposition), and engineering contexts where phase shifts and amplitude relations are analyzed. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the use of trigonometric identities to simplify expressions involving multiple angle shifts, reinforcing understanding of angle transformations and their algebraic consequences.",

Mathematically, it states that the ratio of the height H of an object to the length S of its shadow is equal to the ratio of a smaller height h to its corresponding shadow length s, and both equal the tangent of the sun's altitude angle. Here, H and h represent vertical heights (e.g., of a pyramid and a staff), while S and s denote the lengths of their respective shadows on the ground. The tangent function, tan(θ), where θ is the sun's altitude angle above the horizon, is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. This equation leverages the similarity of triangles formed by the object and its shadow, a principle historically used by Thales and ancient Indian mathematicians to solve height and distance problems. The equation's application domain is classical geometry and trigonometry, particularly in practical measurement scenarios such as determining inaccessible heights by measuring shadows and angles. The physical significance lies in its use of solar altitude to relate measurable shadow lengths to object heights, enabling indirect measurement. The equation connects to broader trigonometric concepts like angle functions and similarity of triangles, foundational in both theoretical and applied mathematics. Practically, it is used in surveying, astronomy, and navigation, illustrating the historical development and utility of trigonometric functions in real-world problem solving. Within the broader historical context, this equation exemplifies the transition from geometric proportionality methods to trigonometric function-based approaches in ancient Indian and Greek mathematics, highlighting the evolution and dissemination of trigonometric knowledge.",

A vertical line segment AC represents the height of an object, such as a pyramid or a tower. A horizontal line segment BC represents the distance from the observer to the base of the object. The triangle is drawn with clear, bold black lines on a white background, with points A, B, and C marked with capital letters in black. Additional smaller triangles and line segments are drawn within or adjacent to the main triangle to illustrate the concept of similar triangles and proportionality. For example, a smaller triangle ADE is drawn inside the larger triangle, sharing angle A and having points D and E on the base and vertical lines, respectively. The diagram includes several angle notations, such as the angle at point B, which is marked with a curved arc and labeled with a Greek letter (likely theta or alpha) to indicate the angle of elevation or depression. The image also contains numerical labels or variables along the sides of the triangles, such as h for height, d for distance, and possibly x or y for other segments, indicating the lengths or unknowns to be solved. The lines are straight and precise, suggesting the use of a ruler or digital drawing tool, and the style is schematic and educational, typical of textbook illustrations. The lighting is uniform with no shadows, emphasizing clarity and readability. The image visually supports the surrounding text on page 31, which discusses the historical development of trigonometry, the use of similar triangles for height and distance problems, and references to Thales' method of measuring the height of a pyramid by comparing shadows. The diagram concretely represents these concepts by showing how the height of an object can be determined using the ratios of sides in similar triangles, reinforcing the mathematical principles described in the text.",
