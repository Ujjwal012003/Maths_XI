HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In",

For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",

Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a).

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1,",

All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Also $\\mathrm{C} = \\{5\\}$ but $-5 \\in \\mathrm{D}$ , hence $\\mathrm{C} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{E}$ . Further, $\\mathrm{D} = \\{-5, 5\\}$ and $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , we find that, $\\mathrm{D} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ .

The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies.

If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A.

Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of $\\mathbf{T}$ include $\\sqrt{2}$ , $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\pi$ . \n\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are: \n\n1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of $R$ Let $a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ . Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in",

For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample",

Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$",

If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ .

These are called De Morgan's laws. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan. \n\nThe complement $\\mathrm{A}'$ of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A. \n\nSome Properties of Complement Sets \n\nThese laws can be verified by using Venn diagrams. \n\nEXERCISE 1.5 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{B} = \\{d,e,f,g\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathbf{C} = \\{a,c,e,g\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\mathrm{D} = \\{f,g,h,a\\}$ \n\n3.

These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.",

This is an example of a set defined using a predicate, where the condition for membership in the set is specified by the equation. The solution to this equation is $x = 5$, which means that the set C contains only one element, namely 5.\n\nMathematically, this equation can be interpreted as a statement about the existence of a root of the linear polynomial $x - 5$. In other words, it asserts that there exists a value of x such that when substituted into the polynomial, the result is zero. This is a fundamental concept in algebra and has far-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics.\n\nIn the context of set theory, this equation illustrates the idea of defining a set using a condition or predicate. The set C is defined as the collection of all values of x that satisfy the given equation, which can be thought of as a filter or a sieve that selects certain elements from the universe of discourse (in this case, the real numbers).\n\nThe significance of this equation lies in its connection to other mathematical concepts, such as linear equations, polynomial roots, and set theory. It also highlights the importance of precise language and notation in mathematics, as the use of set-builder notation ($\\{x: \\text{condition}\\}$) allows for a clear and concise definition of the set C.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, this equation has implications in various fields, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, and computer science.

This is denoted by the symbol ⊂. The equation states that for any element a in A, it implies that a is also in B. This definition is crucial in understanding the relationships between sets and their elements.\n\n    In this context, the variables A and B represent sets, while a represents an arbitrary element of set A. The implication operator (⇒) indicates that if a is an element of A, then it must also be an element of B for A to be considered a subset of B.\n\n    This equation has significant implications in various mathematical disciplines, including set theory, algebra, and topology. It provides the foundation for understanding concepts such as proper subsets, supersets, and equal sets.\n\n    The relationship between this equation and other mathematical concepts is evident in the context of subset relationships. For instance, if A ⊂ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, and B is a superset of A.\n\n    In practical applications, understanding subset relationships is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It enables the identification of patterns, relationships, and structures within complex datasets and systems.\n\n    The equation's significance extends beyond mathematical theory to real-world problems. For example, in database design, understanding subset relationships helps in optimizing data storage and retrieval processes. In machine learning, it aids in identifying relevant features and relationships between variables.\n\n    Overall, the given equation is a fundamental concept in set theory that has far-reaching implications in various mathematical disciplines and practical applications.",

The complement of a set is defined as the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. In this case, the universal set U consists of all prime numbers and set A consists of all prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Therefore, the complement of A with respect to U is the set of all prime numbers that are divisors of 42. The equation states that the complement of A is equal to {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which means that these five prime numbers are the only elements in U that do not belong to A.

Specifically, it states that the complement of the union of two sets A and B is equal to the intersection of their complements, i.e., (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'. This equation can be interpreted as follows: if we take the complement of a set A and the complement of another set B, and then find their intersection, it will result in the same set as taking the union of A and B and finding its complement. In other words, this law allows us to switch between the operations of union and intersection when dealing with complements of sets.",

The diagram consists of three overlapping circles representing the sets A, B, and X. Set A intersects with set X at point A ∩ X = φ, while set B also intersects with set X at point B ∩ X = φ. However, when considering the union of sets A and X (A ∪ X) and the union of sets B and X (B ∪ X), it is shown that these unions are equal. The diagram illustrates this equality by overlapping the circles representing sets A and B with set X. This visual representation supports the mathematical proof provided in the surrounding text, which aims to show that if A ∩ X = B ∩ X = φ and A ∪ X = B ∪ X for some set X, then A = B.\n\nThe diagram is drawn in a simple yet clear style, with each circle labeled accordingly. The colors used are standard mathematical notation colors, with black representing the sets and white representing the background. The lighting is neutral, providing no distractions from the visual representation of the sets.\n\nIn terms of technical details, the diagram appears to be hand-drawn or created using a simple drawing tool",

    "content": "RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. - BERTHELOT \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nMuch of mathematics is about finding a pattern - a recognisable link between quantities that change. In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The \n\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. \n\n2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets \n\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e., \n\nwhere $b, c$ and $s$ represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively. \n\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets? \n\nProceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below: \n\n(red, $b$ ), (red, $c$ ), (red, $s$ ), (blue, $b$ ), (blue, $c$ ), (blue, $s$ ). \n\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). \n\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ is a pair of elements written in small \n\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., $(p,q), p \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $q \\in \\mathrm{Q}$ . This leads to the following definition: \n\nDefinition 1 Given two non-empty sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . The cartesian product $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ , i.e., \n\nIf either $\\mathrm{P}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the null set, then $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ will also be empty set, i.e., $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\phi$ \n\nFrom the illustration given above we note that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(\\mathrm{red},b),(\\mathrm{red},c),(\\mathrm{red},s),(\\mathrm{blue},b),(\\mathrm{blue},c),(\\mathrm{blue},s)\\} .$ \n\nAgain, consider the two sets: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{\\mathrm{DL}, \\mathrm{MP}, \\mathrm{KA}\\}$ , where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{01,02,03\\}$ representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP",

This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL). \n\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and \n\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position $(a_{1}, b_{2})$ will be distinct from the point in the position $(b_{2}, a_{1})$ . \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal. \n\nExample 1 If $(x + 1, y - 2) = (3, 1)$ , find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal. \n\nTherefore $x + 1 = 3$ and $y - 2 = 1$ \n\nSolving we get $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ . \n\nExample 2 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{r\\}$ , form the sets $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nAre these two products equal? \n\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product, \n\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair $(a, r)$ is not equal to the pair $(r, a)$ , we conclude that $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} \\neq \\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nHowever, the number of elements in each set will be the same. \n\nExample 3 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3,4\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{4,5,6\\}$ .

We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as 'map' or 'mapping' used to denote a function. \n\nDefinition 5 A relation $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if every element of set $A$ has one and only one image in set $B$ . \n\nIn other words, a function $f$ is a relation from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ such that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and no two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element. \n\nIf $f$ is a function from A to B and $(a, b) \\in f$ , then $f(a) = b$ , where $b$ is called the image of $a$ under $f$ and $a$ is called the preimage of $b$ under $f$ . \n\nThe function $f$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ is denoted by $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image. \n\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and the relation $\\mathbf{R}$ be defined on $\\mathbf{N}$ such that $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}\\}$ . \n\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function? \n\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N. The range is the set of even natural numbers. \n\nSince every natural number $n$ has one and only one image, this relation is a function. \n\nExample 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not? \n\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function. \n\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a real function. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers.

He considered a function in terms of \"mathematical job\" – the \"employee\" being just a curve. \n\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval. \n\nFunction is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: \"The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities\".",

The Cartesian product is a fundamental concept in set theory that describes the set of all ordered pairs formed by taking one element from each of the two sets. In this context, set A consists of two elements: red and blue, representing colors, while set B comprises three elements: b, c, and s, representing specific objects (bag, coat, and shirt).

This concept is crucial in mathematics as it enables the description of relationships between sets and their elements, which is essential for various mathematical operations and functions.\n\nThe equation also highlights the importance of order in forming ordered pairs. For instance, the pair $(red,b)$ is distinct from $(b, red)$. This distinction is critical in understanding the Cartesian product's role in defining functions, as it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity and another.\n\nFurthermore, the equation illustrates the application domain of the Cartesian product in real-world scenarios. In this case, the ordered pairs can represent colored objects, emphasizing the practical significance of set theory in describing relationships between sets and their elements.\n\nThe equation's relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context is that it builds upon the definition of an ordered pair and introduces the concept of the Cartesian product as a means of linking pairs of objects from two sets.

In this specific case, A × B is defined as {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. This means that the elements of set A are paired with the elements of set B to form ordered pairs.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted in terms of relations and functions. Since A × B represents a relation from set A to set B, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. The given relation R = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} can be seen as a specific instance of this relation.\n\nIn terms of functions, the equation implies that there exists a function f from set A to set B such that f(1) = 3 and f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3 and f(2) = 4. However, since no two distinct ordered pairs in f have the same first element, this relation does not satisfy the definition of a function.\n\nThe equation's significance lies in its representation of the Cartesian product and relations between sets. It highlights the importance of understanding the properties of relations and functions in mathematics, particularly in the context of set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of mathematical operations and functions used, the equation involves the Cartesian product operation (×) and the concept of relations and functions. The equation also relies on the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation.\n\nThe application domain and context based on surrounding material are set theory and abstract algebra. The equation is relevant to understanding the properties of relations and functions in these areas.\n\nIn terms of physical or theoretical significance, the equation represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has numerous applications in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and physics.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context includes the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation, as well as the concept of functions. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of practical applications or use cases, the equation has implications for understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science, as well as modeling real-world phenomena in physics and engineering.\n\nThe equation's significance within the broader framework is that it represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has far-reaching implications for various fields.

The result is another function, (f + g), which maps each element x in X to the sum of the corresponding values of f(x) and g(x). This operation is fundamental in the algebra of real functions, enabling the combination of different functions to create new ones.\n\n    In this context, the equation highlights the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The addition of two functions is defined element-wise, meaning that for each x in X, the value of (f + g)(x) is obtained by adding the values of f(x) and g(x). This approach allows for the creation of new functions from existing ones, which is essential in various mathematical applications.\n\n    The equation's significance extends to the broader discussion on real functions. It demonstrates how different operations can be performed on functions, enabling the manipulation and combination of functions to solve problems or model real-world phenomena. The concept of pointwise addition is crucial in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and functional equations.\n\n    In practical applications, this equation has implications for various fields, such as signal processing, control theory, and optimization. For instance, the sum of two functions can represent the combination of different signals or the aggregation of multiple variables in a system.

The concept of linear functions is also relevant here, as f(x) = mx + c is an example of a linear function.\n\nPractical applications of these equations include modeling real-world phenomena, solving optimization problems, and analyzing data. For instance, in economics, the sum of two functions representing different economic variables can be used to model economic growth or inflation.\n\nThe equation (f - g)(x) = √x - x also has practical significance, as it represents the difference between two functions. This concept is crucial in various fields, including physics and engineering, where the difference between two physical quantities can be used to model real-world phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, these equations demonstrate the fundamental concepts of pointwise operations on real-valued functions and their applications in various fields.

The result is a new function that combines the properties of both f and g. Additionally, the quotient of f by g, denoted as (f/g)(x), is also provided. This equation demonstrates the application of pointwise multiplication and division in real functions.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation involve understanding the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The product (f*g)(x) = √x * x results in a new function that can be simplified to x^(3/2). Similarly, the quotient (f/g)(x) = √x / x simplifies to x^(-1/2), which is valid for x ≠ 0.\n\nThe variables and their definitions are as follows: f(x) represents the square root of x, g(x) represents x itself, and the result of the product or quotient operation depends on these functions. The mathematical operations used include multiplication (pointwise) and division (pointwise).\n\nIn the context of real functions, this equation is significant because it illustrates how different pointwise operations can be applied to combine functions. This concept is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, control systems, and data analysis.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the surrounding material involves understanding the properties of real functions, including their domains, ranges, and pointwise operations. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on algebraic operations with real functions, which is a fundamental topic in mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include solving problems involving function composition, signal processing, and control systems. For instance, understanding how to combine functions through pointwise multiplication and division can help in designing filters, controllers, or other systems that rely on mathematical modeling.\n\nThe broader discussion or framework involves the study of real functions, their properties, and operations. This equation is a specific example of applying these concepts to solve problems and understand the behavior of complex systems.",

The equation states that f(-2) equals 1 minus (-2), which simplifies to 3. This implies that when the input value is -2, the output of the function f is 3.\n\nIn the context of the surrounding material, this equation is likely related to Example 22, where a piecewise-defined function f(x) is introduced. The function f(x) has two different definitions depending on whether x is less than or greater than 0. For x < 0, f(x) = 1 - x.\n\nThe given equation can be seen as an application of this definition to the specific input value x = -2. By substituting x = -2 into the function f(x), we obtain f(-2) = 1 - (-2), which indeed equals 3.\n\nMathematically, this equation involves basic arithmetic operations, including addition and subtraction. The use of parentheses is also crucial in ensuring that the correct order of operations is followed.\n\nIn terms of mathematical concepts, this equation relates to the idea of function evaluation, where a specific input value is plugged into a function to obtain an output value. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and has numerous applications in various fields, including science, engineering, and economics.\n\nPractically, understanding how to evaluate functions at specific points is essential for solving problems in calculus, algebra, and other areas of mathematics. It also has implications for real-world applications, such as modeling population growth, optimizing systems, or predicting outcomes based on given inputs.\n\nIn the broader context of the discussion, this equation contributes to a deeper understanding of function notation, evaluation, and application. It highlights the importance of carefully defining functions and evaluating them at specific points to obtain meaningful results.",

This is an example of a relation between two sets, specifically the set of real numbers. The equation defines a subset of the Cartesian product R × R, which includes all possible ordered pairs (x, y) with x, y ∈ R.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation are that it describes a collection of points in the plane, where each point is an ordered pair of real numbers. This relation can be thought of as a set of rules or constraints on the values of x and y, defining which pairs are included in the relation.\n\nIn the context of functions, this equation represents a relation between two sets, but it does not necessarily define a function. A function requires that each input value (x) corresponds to exactly one output value (y). In contrast, this relation allows for multiple output values for a given input value.\n\nThe variables x and y are defined as real numbers, which means they can take on any value in the set of real numbers. The mathematical operations used in this equation are none, as it simply defines a set of ordered pairs.\n\nIn terms of application domain and context, this equation is relevant to the study of relations and functions in mathematics. It provides a fundamental example of how relations can be defined between sets, and how these relations can be analyzed and interpreted.\n\nThe physical or theoretical significance of this equation lies in its ability to describe complex relationships between variables. In real-world applications, such as physics, engineering, or economics, relations like this one can be used to model and analyze systems, identify patterns, and make predictions.\n\nIn terms of relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context, this equation is closely related to the concept of functions, which are a special type of relation where each input value corresponds to exactly one output value. The equation also touches on the idea of relations between sets, which is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include modeling real-world systems, analyzing data, and making predictions. For example, in physics, this equation could be used to describe the relationship between position and velocity of an object, while in economics, it could be used to model the relationship between supply and demand.\n\nFinally, the equation relates to the broader discussion or framework by providing a fundamental example of how relations can be defined and analyzed.

    "content": "TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS \n\nA mathematician knows how to solve a problem, he can not solve it. - MILNE \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words 'trigon' and 'metron' and it means 'measuring the sides of a triangle'. The subject was originally developed to solve geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a musical tone and in many other areas. \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right \n\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and study their properties. \n\n3.2 Angles \n\nAngle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is \n\ncalled the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation \n\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1). \n\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of rotation performed to get the terminal side from the initial side. There are several units for measuring angles. The definition of an angle \n\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as indicated in Fig 3.2. \n\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz. degree measure and radian measure. \n\n3.2.1 Degree measure If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is $\\left(\\frac{1}{360}\\right)^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as $1^{\\circ}$ . A degree is divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds. One sixtieth of a degree is called a minute, written as $1'$ , and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as $1''$ . Thus, $1^{\\circ} = 60'$ , $1' = 60''$ \n\nSome of the angles whose measures are $360^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ}, 420^{\\circ}, -30^{\\circ}, -420^{\\circ}$ are shown in Fig 3.3. \n\n3.2.2 Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig 3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, $-1$ radian, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian and $-1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian. \n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is $2\\pi$ . Thus, one",

The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, $-1$ radian, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian and $-1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian. \n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is $2\\pi$ . Thus, one complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian. \n\nMore generally, in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ will subtend an angle of 1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre. Since in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ subtends an angle whose measure is 1 radian, an arc of length $l$ will subtend an angle whose measure is $\\frac{l}{r}$ radian. Thus, if in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $l$ subtends an angle $\\theta$ radian at the centre, we have $\\theta = \\frac{l}{r}$ or $l = r\\theta$ . \n\n3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle. Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the real number zero, AP represents positive real number and AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real number will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can be considered as one and the same. \n\n3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre an angle whose radian measure is $2\\pi$ and its degree measure is $360^{\\circ}$ , it follows that \n\nThe above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value of $\\pi$ as $\\frac{22}{7}$ , we have \n\nAlso $1^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radian $= 0.01746$ radian approximately. \n\nThe relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles are given in the following table: \n\nNotational Convention \n\nSince angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention that whenever we write angle $\\theta^{\\circ}$ , we mean the angle whose degree measure is $\\theta$ and whenever we write angle $\\beta$ , we mean the angle whose radian measure is $\\beta$ . \n\nNote that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word 'radian' is frequently omitted. Thus, $\\pi = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 45^{\\circ}$ are written with the understanding that $\\pi$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ are radian measures. Thus, we can say that \n\nRadian measure $= \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\times$ Degree measure \n\nDegree measure $= \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\times$ Radian measure \n\nExample 1 Convert $40^{\\circ}20^{\\prime}$ into radian measure. \n\nSolution We know that $180^{\\circ} = \\pi$ rad",

We will now extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions. \n\nConsider a unit circle with centre at origin of the coordinate axes. Let $\\mathrm{P}(a,b)$ be any point on the circle with angle $\\mathrm{AOP} = x$ radian, i.e., length of arc $\\mathrm{AP} = x$ (Fig 3.6). \n\nWe define $\\cos x = a$ and $\\sin x = b$ Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{OMP}$ is a right triangle, we have \n\n$\\mathrm{OM}^2 +\\mathrm{MP}^2 = \\mathrm{OP}^2$ or $a^2 +b^2 = 1$ Thus, for every point on the unit circle, we have \n\nSince one complete revolution subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian at the centre of the circle, $\\angle \\mathrm{AOB} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ \n\n$\\angle \\mathrm{AOC} = \\pi$ and $\\angle \\mathrm{AOD} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ . All angles which are integral multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ are called quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively, $(1,0)$ , $(0,1)$ , $(-1,0)$ and $(0, -1)$ . Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have \n\nNow, if we take one complete revolution from the point $\\mathrm{P}$ , we again come back to same point $\\mathrm{P}$ . Thus, we also observe that if $x$ increases (or decreases) by any integral multiple of $2\\pi$ , the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus, \n\nFurther, $\\sin x = 0$ , if $x = 0, \\pm \\pi, \\pm 2\\pi, \\pm 3\\pi, \\ldots$ , i.e., when $x$ is an integral multiple of $\\pi$ and $\\cos x = 0$ , if $x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots$ i.e., $\\cos x$ vanishes when $x$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ .

Similarly, $\\cos x$ is positive for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , negative for $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and also positive for $\\frac{3\\pi}{2} < x < 2\\pi$ . Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table. \n\n3.3.2 Domain and range of trigonometric functions From the definition of sine and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further, we observe that for each real number $x$ , \n\nThus, domain of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\cos x$ is the set of all real numbers and range is the interval $[-1, 1]$ , i.e., $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$ . \n\nSince $\\operatorname{cosec} x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$ , the domain of $y = \\operatorname{cosec} x$",

In fact, we have the following table: \n\nRemark In the above table, the statement $\\tan x$ increases from 0 to $\\infty$ (infinity) for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ simply means that $\\tan x$ increases as $x$ increases for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and \n\nassumes arbitrarily large positive values as $x$ approaches to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ .

Let $x$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_1$ and $y$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Then $(x + y)$ is the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Also let $(-y)$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_3$ . Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4$ will have the coordinates $\\mathrm{P}_1(\\cos x, \\sin x), \\mathrm{P}_2[\\cos (x + y), \\sin (x + y)], \\mathrm{P}_3[\\cos (-y), \\sin (-y)]$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4(1, 0)$ (Fig 3.14). \n\nConsider the triangles $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{OP}_4$ . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ are equal. By using distance formula, we get \n\nAlso, $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2 = [1 - \\cos (x + y)]^2 + [0 - \\sin (x + y)]^2$ \n\nSince $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ , we have $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3^2 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2$ . \n\nTherefore, $2 - 2$ (cos $x$ cos $y - \\sin x$ sin $y) = 2 - 2$ cos $(x + y)$ \n\nHence $\\cos (x + y) = \\cos x\\cos y - \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\n4. $\\cos (x - y) = \\cos x\\cos y + \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\nReplacing $y$ by $-y$ in identity 3, we get \n\n5. $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\sin x$ \n\nIf we replace $x$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $y$ by $x$ in Identity (4), we get \n\n6. $\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\cos x$ \n\nUsing the Identity 5, we have \n\n7. $\\sin (x + y) = \\sin x\\cos y + \\cos x\\sin y$ \n\nWe know that \n\n8",

The ancient Indian Mathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and Bhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world. \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of mathematics. \n\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than $90^{\\circ}$ . A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa (period) contains a proof for the expansion of $\\sin (A + B)$ . Exact expression for sines or cosines of $18^{\\circ}$ , $36^{\\circ}$ , $54^{\\circ}$ , $72^{\\circ}$ , etc., are given by Bhaskara II. \n\nThe symbols $\\sin^{-1}x$ , $\\cos^{-1}x$ , etc., for arc $\\sin x$ , arc $\\cos x$ , etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: \n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.",

The composition centers on a coordinate plane with a horizontal initial side represented by a ray extending from a vertex point at the origin. The vertex is clearly marked as the point of rotation. From this vertex, a second ray, the terminal side, is shown rotated anticlockwise from the initial side, forming an angle between the two rays. The angle is labeled with a curved arc between the initial and terminal sides, indicating the measure of the positive angle. The rays and angle arc are drawn in black lines on a white background, ensuring clarity and focus on the geometric elements. The image is simple and schematic, designed to visually explain the definition of a positive angle as an anticlockwise rotation from the initial side to the terminal side. The diagram aligns with the surrounding textual content that introduces angles, their measurement, and the distinction between positive and negative angles based on rotation direction. The visual style is minimalistic and educational, typical of mathematical textbooks, emphasizing conceptual understanding without extraneous details or color distractions. There are no additional objects, people, or text within the image aside from the caption '(i)Positive angle' which reinforces the instructional purpose of the figure.",

The diagram features a circle centered at point O, labeled as the origin or center of the circle. A radius OA is drawn from the center O to a point A on the circumference, representing the initial side of an angle. Another radius OB extends from O to a point B on the circumference, representing the terminal side of the angle. The arc length AB on the circle is highlighted, indicating the portion of the circumference subtended by the angle at the center O. The angle formed between OA and OB at O is marked, likely denoted as θ (theta), representing the radian measure of the angle. The circle is a unit circle, meaning its radius is 1 unit, which is crucial for defining the radian measure as the length of the arc subtended by the angle. The diagram uses clear, simple lines with black strokes on a white background, typical of educational mathematical illustrations. The points O, A, and B are labeled with capital letters, and the arc AB is often marked with a curved line or arc symbol to emphasize the length corresponding to the radian measure. The layout is clean and uncluttered, focusing on the relationship between the radius, arc length, and angle measure. This visual directly supports the textual explanation of radian measure, showing how an arc length equal to the radius corresponds to an angle of 1 radian. The image is integral to understanding the transition from degree measure to radian measure and the geometric interpretation of radians on the unit circle.",

The circle is drawn with a black outline on a white background. There are four subfigures labeled (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), each illustrating different angles measured in radians. In each subfigure, the initial side of the angle is represented by the line segment OA, which is fixed along the positive x-axis. The terminal side of the angle is represented by the line segment OB, which rotates around the center O. The angles shown are 1 radian, -1 radian, 1.5 radians (1 1/2), and -1.5 radians (-1 1/2) respectively. The positive angles (1 and 1.5 radians) are shown as counterclockwise rotations from OA to OB, while the negative angles (-1 and -1.5 radians) are shown as clockwise rotations. Each subfigure includes an arc between OA and OB, highlighted to indicate the length of the arc corresponding to the radian measure. The arc length is visually proportional to the radian value, demonstrating the concept that the radian measure of an angle is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. The points O, A, and B are marked clearly, with O at the center, A on the circumference at the positive x-axis, and B on the circumference at the terminal side of the angle. The image uses simple line drawings with black lines and no additional colors or shading. The layout is clean and schematic, designed to visually explain the radian measure concept as described in the surrounding text. The image directly supports the explanation of radian measure by showing how different radian values correspond to arcs on the unit circle, including positive and negative angles, reinforcing the mathematical definitions and relationships discussed in the text.",

The formula used is r = l / θ, which arises from the definition of radian measure where the length of an arc intercepted by a central angle θ on a circle of radius r is l = rθ. Here, the arc length l is 37.4 cm, and the central angle θ is 60 degrees, converted to radians as θ = (60π)/180 = π/3. Substituting these values, the radius is computed as r = (37.4 × 3) / π. Using the approximation π = 22/7, the expression is further simplified to r = (37.4 × 3 × 7) / 22, yielding approximately 35.7 cm. This calculation exemplifies the practical use of radian measure in relating linear and angular quantities in circular geometry. It also demonstrates the conversion between degrees and radians and the application of π approximations in computations.

Here, 'a' and 'b' denote the x- and y-coordinates, respectively, of a point P(a,b) on the unit circle centered at the origin, where the angle x (in radians) is the measure of the arc length from the positive x-axis to the point P. The equation asserts that the sum of the squares of the cosine and sine of any angle x is always unity, reflecting the radius of the unit circle. This identity arises from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by the radius (hypotenuse of length 1), and the projections on the x- and y-axes (legs of lengths |a| and |b|). The functions cos x and sin x are defined as the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to angle x, extending the trigonometric ratios beyond acute angles to all real numbers. This equation is foundational in trigonometry, underpinning the periodicity and symmetry properties of sine and cosine functions, and is essential in solving trigonometric equations, analyzing waveforms, and modeling oscillatory phenomena. It connects geometric interpretations with algebraic identities and serves as a basis for defining other trigonometric functions and identities. In the broader context, it facilitates the extension of trigonometric concepts from right triangles to the unit circle framework, enabling the study of angles of any measure and the development of advanced mathematical and physical theories involving periodicity and harmonic motion.",

The circle is drawn with a solid black line, and the radius is 1 unit, consistent with the unit circle definition. Four key points on the circle are labeled: A at (1,0) on the positive x-axis, B at (0,1) on the positive y-axis, C at (-1,0) on the negative x-axis, and D at (0,-1) on the negative y-axis. A point P with coordinates (a,b) lies on the circumference of the circle in the first quadrant, indicating that both a and b are positive and satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = 1. The angle AOP, denoted as x radians, is shown as the angle subtended at the origin O between the positive x-axis (line OA) and the radius OP. The arc length AP corresponds to the radian measure x, visually linking the angle to the arc on the circle. A perpendicular line from point P drops down to the x-axis at point M, forming a right triangle OMP with right angle at M. This triangle illustrates the geometric basis for defining sine and cosine functions: OM equals a (cos x) and MP equals b (sin x). The image uses black lines and points with labels in black text on a white background, maintaining clarity and focus on the geometric relationships. The visual style is schematic and educational, designed to support the explanation of trigonometric functions in terms of the unit circle and radian measure. The image directly relates to the surrounding text, which discusses extending trigonometric ratios to any angle using radian measure, defining cosine and sine as the x and y coordinates of point P on the unit circle, and establishing the fundamental identity a^2 + b^2 = 1. The diagram effectively supports the conceptual transition from right triangle definitions to unit circle definitions of trigonometric functions.",

Here, x is a real variable representing an angle measured in radians. The cotangent function, cot x, is defined as the ratio of cosine to sine, cot x = cos x / sin x, and the secant function, sec x, is the reciprocal of cosine, sec x = 1 / cos x. The equation arises from the primary Pythagorean identity sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1 by dividing through by sin^2 x, yielding 1 + cot^2 x = csc^2 x, and similarly by dividing through by cos^2 x, yielding 1 + tan^2 x = sec^2 x. This particular identity emphasizes the relationship between cotangent and secant, showing that the sum of 1 and the square of cotangent equals the square of secant. It is valid for all x where sine and cosine are nonzero to avoid division by zero. The identity is crucial in simplifying trigonometric expressions, solving equations, and analyzing periodic phenomena. Within the broader context of the unit circle and trigonometric function properties discussed, this identity complements the understanding of function values, signs in different quadrants, and the periodicity of trigonometric functions. It also underpins the derivation of other trigonometric identities and is widely used in calculus, physics, and engineering to model oscillatory behavior and waveforms.",

The circle is drawn with a black outline on a white background. The coordinate axes are clearly marked with the horizontal axis labeled as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis, both extending beyond the circle. Four key points on the circle are labeled: A at (1,0) on the positive x-axis, B at (0,1) on the positive y-axis, C at (-1,0) on the negative x-axis, and D at (0,-1) on the negative y-axis. These points correspond to the quadrantal angles 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2 respectively. Another point P is marked on the circumference in the first quadrant, with coordinates (a,b), where both a and b are positive. A line segment OP is drawn from the origin to point P, forming an angle x with the positive x-axis. Additionally, a point Q is shown with coordinates (a,-b) in the fourth quadrant, reflecting point P across the x-axis, illustrating the relationship between angles x and -x. The image uses black lines and text for clarity, with no additional colors or shading. The visual style is schematic and mathematical, focusing on clarity and precision. The image supports the surrounding text by visually demonstrating the definitions and properties of sine and cosine functions on the unit circle, the concept of quadrantal angles, and the symmetry properties of trigonometric functions with respect to the x-axis. It effectively illustrates how the coordinates of points on the unit circle correspond to cosine and sine values of angles, and how these values change with angle sign inversion.",

Each cell describes the behavior of the function within the respective quadrant in terms of increasing or decreasing values and their ranges. For example, sin increases from 0 to 1 in the first quadrant and decreases from 1 to 0 in the second quadrant, reflecting its positive values in the first two quadrants and negative values in the last two. Cos decreases from 1 to 0 in the first quadrant and continues decreasing to -1 in the second quadrant, then increases back to 1 in the fourth quadrant, matching its sign changes across quadrants. Tan and cot show asymptotic behavior with values tending to infinity or negative infinity near quadrant boundaries, consistent with their undefined points at multiples of π/2. Sec and csc, being reciprocals of cos and sin respectively, exhibit ranges outside [-1,1] and show increasing or decreasing trends towards infinity or negative infinity in each quadrant. The table clearly illustrates the periodic and sign-changing nature of trigonometric functions across the four quadrants, supporting the textual explanation of domain, range, and sign behavior of these functions. It also visually confirms the increasing/decreasing trends and asymptotic limits discussed in the surrounding content, such as sin x increasing from 0 to 1 in the first quadrant and tan x increasing to infinity as x approaches π/2 from the left. The relationships between the functions, such as reciprocal identities (sec = 1/cos, csc = 1/sin) and complementary behavior of tan and cot, are implicitly supported by the mirrored increasing/decreasing patterns and range limits. This table is significant as it consolidates the quadrant-wise behavior of all six primary trigonometric functions, providing a comprehensive reference that complements the theoretical domain and range discussions and the sign analysis of trigonometric functions in the text.",

The graph is drawn on a Cartesian coordinate system with the horizontal axis labeled as 'x' and the vertical axis labeled as 'cosec x'. The x-axis is marked with key points at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π, each labeled clearly with their respective symbols. The y-axis includes numerical values ranging from -5 to 5, with horizontal grid lines aiding in visualizing the function's values. The graph of cosec x is depicted as a series of two distinct branches in each period, showing vertical asymptotes at points where sin x equals zero, specifically at x = 0, π, and 2π, where the function tends to infinity or negative infinity. The branches approach these asymptotes sharply, illustrating the function's behavior of assuming arbitrarily large positive or negative values near these points. The curve is colored in a solid blue line, contrasting against a white background with light gray grid lines. The graph visually confirms the textual explanation that cosec x decreases from -1 to negative infinity in the fourth quadrant and increases from 1 to positive infinity in the first quadrant, repeating this behavior every 2π interval. The image effectively supports the surrounding mathematical context by providing a visual representation of the cosecant function's periodicity, asymptotic behavior, and value ranges, complementing the detailed trigonometric function analysis and examples discussed on pages 11 and 13.",

The graph is plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system with the x-axis labeled in radians, marked at key points 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π. The y-axis represents the values of cosec x, with numerical values indicated at -4, -2, 2, and 4. The graph shows vertical asymptotes at x = 0, π, and 2π, where the function tends to positive or negative infinity, consistent with the undefined values of cosec x at these points. Between these asymptotes, the curve exhibits two distinct branches: in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), the curve descends from positive infinity to 1, then rises again towards positive infinity as it approaches π from the left; in the third quadrant (π to 3π/2), the curve descends from negative infinity to -1, then rises back towards negative infinity as it approaches 2π from the left. The graph is drawn with a smooth blue curve, and the background is white with black axes and grid lines for clarity. The title or label 'Fig 3.13' is positioned near the graph, indicating its reference in the surrounding mathematical text. The graph visually supports the textual explanation of the behavior of cosec x, including its periodicity, asymptotic behavior, and values in different quadrants, as discussed in the surrounding content. The image is a technical mathematical plot used to illustrate the properties of the cosecant function in a trigonometry context.",

Specifically, cosine is periodic with period 360°, so adding multiples of 360° to the angle does not change its value. Here, -1710° + 1800° = 90°, and thus cos(-1710°) = cos(90°) = 0. The variables involved are angles measured in degrees, and the function used is the cosine trigonometric function. This equation exemplifies the fundamental periodicity property of trigonometric functions, which is crucial in simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving problems involving large or negative angles. It relates directly to the surrounding context where the periodicity of sine and cosine functions is used to find values of trigonometric functions for angles outside the standard interval [0°, 360°]. The physical or theoretical significance lies in the understanding of wave behavior, oscillations, and rotations where angles can be normalized within a principal range. This concept is foundational in trigonometry, signal processing, and physics.

The diagram is centered on a unit circle with its center at the origin O of a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle is drawn with a bold black outline, and the coordinate axes are marked with arrows indicating positive directions. Four points labeled P1, P2, P3, and P4 lie on the circumference of the circle. Point P4 is positioned at (1, 0) on the positive x-axis, serving as the reference point. Point P1 corresponds to the angle x, located counterclockwise from P4, with coordinates (cos x, sin x). Point P2 represents the angle (x + y), further counterclockwise from P1, with coordinates (cos(x + y), sin(x + y)). Point P3 corresponds to the angle -y, clockwise from P4, with coordinates (cos(-y), sin(-y)). The points are connected by line segments forming triangles P1OP3 and P2OP4, which are highlighted to show their congruence. The diagram uses thin black lines for the circle and axes, and slightly thicker lines for the triangles and chords to emphasize the geometric relationships. The angles x, y, and (x + y) are indicated by arcs near the origin, with small arrowheads showing the direction of measurement. The layout visually supports the explanation in the surrounding text by demonstrating how the distances and coordinates relate to the trigonometric identity. The image uses a clean, mathematical style typical of textbook diagrams, with clear labels and no extraneous colors or shading. The lighting is uniform and flat, consistent with a line drawing. This visual aids in understanding the derivation of the cosine sum formula by showing the geometric interpretation on the unit circle and the congruence of triangles involved in the proof.",

Specifically, P1 has coordinates (cos x, sin x) and P3 has coordinates (cos(-y), sin(-y)), which simplifies to (cos y, -sin y) due to the even and odd properties of cosine and sine respectively. The equation calculates the Euclidean distance squared between these points using the distance formula: (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2. The algebraic expansion involves squaring the differences of cosine and sine components, leading to terms involving cos²x, cos²y, sin²x, sin²y, and cross terms -2 cos x cos y and +2 sin x sin y. Utilizing the Pythagorean identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, the sum of squared cosine and sine terms simplifies to 2. The final expression, 2 - 2(cos x cos y - sin x sin y), reveals a direct connection to the cosine of the sum of angles identity, since cos(x + y) = cos x cos y - sin x sin y. Thus, the squared distance between P1 and P3 is expressed as 2 - 2 cos(x + y), linking geometric distance on the unit circle to trigonometric sum formulas. This equation is derived in the context of proving the cosine addition formula using geometric arguments involving congruent triangles and the unit circle. It highlights the interplay between geometry and trigonometry, demonstrating how distances correspond to trigonometric identities. The variables x and y represent angles subtended at the origin, and the points correspond to positions on the unit circle. The equation uses fundamental trigonometric functions (sine and cosine), their parity properties, and the Pythagorean identity. This analysis is foundational in trigonometry, underpinning the derivation of sum and difference formulas, which have broad applications in physics, engineering, signal processing, and any domain involving periodic phenomena. It also illustrates the geometric interpretation of trigonometric identities, reinforcing the conceptual understanding of angle addition formulas within the broader framework of trigonometric functions and their properties.",

The left-hand side (L.H.S.) starts as a combination of products of cosines: 2 cos(2x) cos(x/2) and 2 cos(9x/2) cos(3x). Using the product-to-sum formulas, these products are converted into sums of cosines with arguments that are sums and differences of the original angles. Specifically, the identity cos A cos B = (1/2)[cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] is applied. After simplification, terms cancel out, leaving a difference of cosines. This difference is then transformed into a product of sines using the identity cos A - cos B = -2 sin((A+B)/2) sin((A-B)/2). The final expression is a product of sine functions: sin(5x) sin(5x/2), which matches the right-hand side (R.H.S.) of the equation, confirming the identity. Variables: x is a real variable, typically representing an angle measured in radians. Mathematical operations include multiplication, addition, subtraction, and the use of trigonometric functions cosine and sine. The equation is situated within the context of trigonometric identities and transformations, useful in simplifying expressions involving multiple angles. The theoretical significance lies in demonstrating the equivalence of complex trigonometric expressions through standard identities, facilitating problem-solving in trigonometry, Fourier analysis, and signal processing.

Specifically, it proves that the sum \\( \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 \\left(x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\cos^2 \\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\). The proof uses the double-angle identity for cosine squared, \\( \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} \\), to rewrite each term. The variables are: \\( x \\), a real variable representing an angle in radians; the constants \\( \\pi \\) and fractions thereof represent fixed angular shifts. The operations include cosine function, addition, multiplication, and the use of the cosine addition formula \\( \\cos(a + b) + \\cos(a - b) = 2 \\cos a \\cos b \\). The identity leverages the symmetry and periodicity of cosine to simplify the sum to a constant value \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), independent of \\( x \\). This result is significant in trigonometry and Fourier analysis, illustrating how shifted cosine squares sum to a constant, reflecting orthogonality and energy distribution in harmonic components. It relates to other trigonometric identities and is useful in signal processing, physics (wave superposition), and engineering contexts where phase shifts and amplitude relations are analyzed. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the use of trigonometric identities to simplify expressions involving multiple angle shifts, reinforcing understanding of angle transformations and their algebraic consequences.",

Mathematically, it states that the ratio of the height H of an object to the length S of its shadow is equal to the ratio of a smaller height h to its corresponding shadow length s, and both equal the tangent of the sun's altitude angle. Here, H and h represent vertical heights (e.g., of a pyramid and a staff), while S and s denote the lengths of their respective shadows on the ground. The tangent function, tan(θ), where θ is the sun's altitude angle above the horizon, is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. This equation leverages the similarity of triangles formed by the object and its shadow, a principle historically used by Thales and ancient Indian mathematicians to solve height and distance problems. The equation's application domain is classical geometry and trigonometry, particularly in practical measurement scenarios such as determining inaccessible heights by measuring shadows and angles. The physical significance lies in its use of solar altitude to relate measurable shadow lengths to object heights, enabling indirect measurement. The equation connects to broader trigonometric concepts like angle functions and similarity of triangles, foundational in both theoretical and applied mathematics. Practically, it is used in surveying, astronomy, and navigation, illustrating the historical development and utility of trigonometric functions in real-world problem solving. Within the broader historical context, this equation exemplifies the transition from geometric proportionality methods to trigonometric function-based approaches in ancient Indian and Greek mathematics, highlighting the evolution and dissemination of trigonometric knowledge.",

A vertical line segment AC represents the height of an object, such as a pyramid or a tower. A horizontal line segment BC represents the distance from the observer to the base of the object. The triangle is drawn with clear, bold black lines on a white background, with points A, B, and C marked with capital letters in black. Additional smaller triangles and line segments are drawn within or adjacent to the main triangle to illustrate the concept of similar triangles and proportionality. For example, a smaller triangle ADE is drawn inside the larger triangle, sharing angle A and having points D and E on the base and vertical lines, respectively. The diagram includes several angle notations, such as the angle at point B, which is marked with a curved arc and labeled with a Greek letter (likely theta or alpha) to indicate the angle of elevation or depression. The image also contains numerical labels or variables along the sides of the triangles, such as h for height, d for distance, and possibly x or y for other segments, indicating the lengths or unknowns to be solved. The lines are straight and precise, suggesting the use of a ruler or digital drawing tool, and the style is schematic and educational, typical of textbook illustrations. The lighting is uniform with no shadows, emphasizing clarity and readability. The image visually supports the surrounding text on page 31, which discusses the historical development of trigonometry, the use of similar triangles for height and distance problems, and references to Thales' method of measuring the height of a pyramid by comparing shadows. The diagram concretely represents these concepts by showing how the height of an object can be determined using the ratios of sides in similar triangles, reinforcing the mathematical principles described in the text.",

We have seen that the equation $x^{2} + 1 = 0$ has no real solution as $x^{2} + 1 = 0$ gives $x^{2} = -1$ and square of every real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the real number system to a larger system so that we can find the solution of the equation $x^{2} = -1$ . In fact, the main objective is to solve the equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ , where $\\mathrm{D} = b^{2} - 4ac < 0$ , which is not possible in the system of real numbers. \n\n4.2 Complex Numbers \n\nLet us denote $\\sqrt{-1}$ by the symbol $i$ . Then, we have $i^2 = -1$ . This means that $i$ is a solution of the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ . \n\nA number of the form $a + ib$ , where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, is defined to be a complex number. For example, $2 + i3$ , $(-1) + i\\sqrt{3}$ , $4 + i\\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right)$ are complex numbers. \n\nFor the complex number $z = a + ib$ , $a$ is called the real part, denoted by $\\operatorname{Re} z$ and $b$ is called the imaginary part denoted by $\\operatorname{Im} z$ of the complex number $z$ . For example, if $z = 2 + i5$ , then $\\operatorname{Re} z = 2$ and $\\operatorname{Im} z = 5$ . \n\nTwo complex numbers $z_{1} = a + ib$ and $z_{2} = c + id$ are equal if $a = c$ and $b = d$ . \n\nExample 1 If $4x + i(3x - y) = 3 + i(-6)$ , where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution We have \n\nEquating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get \n\nwhich, on solving simultaneously, give $x = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $y = \\frac{33}{4}$ . \n\n4.3 Algebra of Complex Numbers \n\nIn this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers. \n\n4.3.1 Addition of two complex numbers Let $z_{1} = a + ib$ and $z_{2} = c + id$ be any two complex numbers. Then, the sum $z_{1} + z_{2}$ is defined as follows: \n\n$z_{1} + z_{2} = (a + c) + i(b + d)$ , which is again a complex number. For example, $(2 + i3) + (-6 + i5) = (2 - 6) + i(3 + 5) = -4 + i8$ \n\nThe addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties: \n\n4.3.2 Difference of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ , the difference $z_{1} - z_{2}$ is defined as follows: \n\nFor example, $(6 + 3i) - (2 - i) = (6 +",

But the credit goes to the Indian mathematician Mahavira (850) who first stated this difficulty clearly. \"He mentions in his work 'Ganitasara Sangraha' as in the nature of things a negative (quantity) is not a square (quantity)', it has, therefore, no square root\". Bhaskara, another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita, written in 1150. \"There is no square root of a negative quantity, for it is not a square.\" Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving \n\nHe obtained $x = 5 + \\sqrt{-15}$ and $y = 5 - \\sqrt{-15}$ as the solution of it, which was discarded by him by saying that these numbers are 'useless'. Albert Girard (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that this will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation. Euler was the first to introduce the symbol $i$ for $\\sqrt{-1}$ and W.R. Hamilton (about 1830) regarded the complex number $a + ib$ as an ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$ thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use of the so-called 'imaginary numbers'.",

Here, x and y are real variables to be determined. The left-hand side (LHS) is a complex number with real part 4x and imaginary part (3x - y), while the right-hand side (RHS) is the complex number with real part 3 and imaginary part -6. The equation asserts that these two complex numbers are equal, which implies equality of their corresponding real and imaginary parts separately: 4x = 3 and 3x - y = -6. This system of linear equations in real variables x and y can be solved simultaneously to find their values. The equation exemplifies the fundamental property of complex numbers that equality holds if and only if both real and imaginary parts are equal. This concept is crucial in the algebra of complex numbers, particularly in solving equations involving complex expressions. It also illustrates the extension of real number solutions to complex solutions, addressing cases where quadratic equations have negative discriminants and no real roots.

The first equation, 4x = 3, is a simple linear equation that can be solved directly for x, yielding x = 3/4. Substituting this value into the second equation, 3x - y = -6, allows solving for y, resulting in y = 33/4. These equations arise from equating the real and imaginary parts of a complex number equality, specifically from the expression 4x + i(3x - y) = 3 + i(-6). Here, x and y are real variables representing coefficients in the complex number expression. The mathematical operations involved include linear algebraic manipulation and substitution. This system exemplifies the method of equating real and imaginary parts to solve for unknowns in complex number equations, a fundamental technique in complex number algebra. The equations illustrate how complex numbers can be used to translate problems into systems of real equations, facilitating solutions that are not possible within the real number system alone. This approach is crucial in solving quadratic equations with negative discriminants by extending the number system to complex numbers. The system also demonstrates the interplay between algebraic structures and complex analysis, highlighting the practical application of complex numbers in solving polynomial equations and in fields such as electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and applied mathematics. Overall, these equations serve as a concrete example within the broader framework of complex number algebra, emphasizing the utility of separating real and imaginary components to solve equations involving complex variables.",

This eliminates the imaginary part in the denominator, leveraging the identity (a - bi)(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2, which equals the modulus squared |z|^2. Here, |z|^2 = 2^2 + (-3)^2 = 13. The resulting expression is (2 + 3i)/13, which is then separated into its real and imaginary parts as (2/13) + (3/13)i. The variables are: z, a complex number with real part 2 and imaginary part -3; i, the imaginary unit satisfying i^2 = -1; and z^{-1}, the multiplicative inverse of z. The operations used include complex conjugation, multiplication, division, and the use of modulus squared. This equation is fundamental in complex number arithmetic, particularly in division and inversion operations, and is crucial in fields such as electrical engineering, signal processing, and quantum mechanics where complex numbers model oscillations and waves. It also illustrates the algebraic structure of the complex field and the geometric interpretation of inversion in the Argand plane. The equation ties into the broader discussion on complex number properties, conjugates, moduli, and their algebraic manipulations, reinforcing the method to express complex division in standard form a + ib.",

The numerator is the product of two complex conjugates, (3 + i√5) and (3 - i√5), which simplifies to the sum of squares of their real and imaginary parts, yielding a real number. Specifically, (3)^2 + (√5)^2 = 9 + 5 = 14. The denominator is the difference between two complex numbers, (√3 + √2 i) and (√3 - i√2), which simplifies by subtracting real and imaginary parts separately, resulting in 2i√2. The entire expression thus simplifies to a real number divided by a purely imaginary number, which can be further simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator or by recognizing the denominator as a purely imaginary number. Variables involved are real numbers and imaginary unit i, where i^2 = -1. The operations used include complex conjugation, multiplication, subtraction, and simplification of complex fractions. This equation fits within the context of complex number arithmetic, particularly manipulation and simplification of complex expressions, as seen in the surrounding examples involving multiplicative inverses and expressing complex numbers in standard form a + ib. The physical or theoretical significance lies in understanding complex number operations, which are foundational in fields such as electrical engineering, quantum mechanics, and applied mathematics. The equation relates to the broader discussion of representing complex numbers in the Argand plane and performing algebraic operations on them. Practically, such simplifications are essential in solving problems involving complex impedance, signal processing, and other applications requiring complex arithmetic. This expression exemplifies the use of conjugates to simplify complex fractions and the importance of recognizing real and imaginary components in complex expressions.",

The original complex fraction is given as (12 + 5i) / (4 + 3i). Multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator (4 - 3i) eliminates the imaginary part in the denominator, resulting in a real denominator (16 + 9 = 25). The numerator expands using distributive property and combines like terms to 63 - 16i. Dividing both parts by 25 yields the simplified form 63/25 - (16/25)i. Variables x and y represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number respectively, consistent with the Argand plane representation z = x + iy. The operations used include complex conjugation, multiplication, addition, and division of complex numbers. This process is fundamental in complex analysis and is used to express complex numbers in standard form a + bi. The equation illustrates the geometric interpretation of complex numbers on the Argand plane, where rationalizing the denominator corresponds to rotating and scaling vectors. It also relates to the concept of modulus and conjugate, as seen in the surrounding context, reinforcing the understanding of complex number arithmetic and their geometric representation. Practical applications include electrical engineering (impedance calculations), signal processing, and any domain requiring manipulation of complex numbers. This equation exemplifies the algebraic manipulation techniques necessary for working within the broader framework of complex number theory discussed in the chapter.",

The simplification uses algebraic expansion and properties of complex conjugates. Variables a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit satisfying i^2 = -1. The numerator expands to a^2 - b^2 + 2abi, and the denominator simplifies to a^2 + b^2, a sum of squares ensuring a nonzero denominator. The resulting expression separates into real and imaginary parts: x = (a^2 - b^2)/(a^2 + b^2) and y = (2ab)/(a^2 + b^2). This form is significant in the context of the Argand plane, where complex numbers are represented as points (x,y). The equation demonstrates how the quotient of complex numbers can be expressed in standard form, facilitating geometric interpretation.

The left-hand side, x^2 + y^2, represents the squared modulus of the complex number z = x + iy, which geometrically corresponds to the squared distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The equation shows that this squared modulus can be expressed as the product (x + iy)(x - iy), which equals the product of a complex number and its conjugate, yielding a real non-negative value. Here, x + iy is given as the quotient (a + ib)/(a - ib), where a and b are real numbers. The equation expands and simplifies the product (x + iy)(x - iy) by substituting x and y in terms of a and b, resulting in the expression ((a^2 - b^2)^2 + 4a^2b^2) / (a^2 + b^2)^2. This numerator simplifies to (a^2 + b^2)^2, which cancels with the denominator, yielding 1. This proves that the modulus squared of the complex number (a + ib)/(a - ib) is 1, meaning the complex number lies on the unit circle in the Argand plane. The variables x and y represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex number z, while a and b are parameters defining the original complex numbers in the quotient. The operations used include complex conjugation, multiplication, division, squaring, and simplification of rational expressions. This equation is significant in complex analysis and geometry, illustrating how certain complex transformations preserve modulus, specifically that the quotient of a complex number and its conjugate has unit modulus. It relates to the broader discussion of representing complex numbers geometrically, understanding conjugates, and modulus properties. Practical applications include signal processing, control theory, and any domain where complex numbers represent rotations or phase shifts, as the unit modulus corresponds to pure rotations without scaling. This equation exemplifies the interplay between algebraic manipulation and geometric interpretation in complex number theory.",

These represent the sum and product of two variables x and y, respectively. In the context of complex numbers and polynomial roots discussed in the surrounding content, x and y can be interpreted as roots of a quadratic polynomial. Specifically, if x and y are roots of the quadratic equation t^2 - (x + y)t + xy = 0, then the equation becomes t^2 - 10t + 40 = 0. The variables x and y are real or complex numbers satisfying these relations. The operations involved are addition and multiplication of real or complex numbers. This system is fundamental in understanding the relationship between roots and coefficients of quadratic polynomials, a key concept in algebra and complex number theory. The physical or theoretical significance lies in solving polynomial equations, which is central to the historical development of complex numbers as described in the context.

The layout centers around a Cartesian coordinate system with a horizontal real axis labeled 'Re' and a vertical imaginary axis labeled 'Im'. The complex number z is depicted as a point or vector originating from the origin (0,0) and terminating at coordinates (a, b), where 'a' and 'b' are non-zero real numbers. This vector is typically shown in a distinct color, such as blue or red, to highlight it against the grid. Adjacent to this vector, the image shows the multiplicative inverse of z, denoted as 1/z or z^{-1}, represented by the point with coordinates (a/(a^2 + b^2), -b/(a^2 + b^2)). This inverse vector is drawn from the origin to this calculated point, often in a contrasting color to differentiate it from z. The diagram may include labels for both vectors, with annotations indicating their coordinates and the formula for the inverse. The background grid aids in visualizing the positions and magnitudes of these points. The lighting is uniform and the style is clean and technical, typical of educational mathematical illustrations. The image visually supports the surrounding textual content on page 11, which discusses the multiplicative inverse of complex numbers, the historical development of complex number theory, and the significance of the imaginary unit i. The diagram concretely demonstrates the algebraic formula for the inverse by mapping it geometrically, reinforcing the theoretical explanation provided in the text. No additional elements such as people or extraneous objects are present, focusing solely on the mathematical visualization.",

    "content": "LINEAR INEQUALITIES \n\nMathematics is the art of saying many things in many different ways. - MAXWELL \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied equations in one variable and two variables and also solved some statement problems by translating them in the form of equations. Now a natural question arises: 'Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the form of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less than $160~\\mathrm{cm}$ . Your classroom can occupy almost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we get certain statements involving a sign $<$ (less than), $>$ (greater than), $≤$ (less than or equal) and $\\geq$ (greater than or equal) which are known as inequalities. \n\nIn this Chapter, we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology, etc. \n\n5.2 Inequalities \n\nLet us consider the following situations: \n\n(i) Ravi goes to market with ₹200 to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The price of one packet of rice is ₹30. If $x$ denotes the number of packets of rice, which he buys, then the total amount spent by him is ₹30x. Since, he has to buy rice in packets only, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of ₹200. (Why?) Hence \n\nClearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality. \n\n(ii) Reshma has $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 120 and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one register is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 40 and that of a pen is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 20. In this case, if $x$ denotes the number of registers and $y$ , the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by her is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}} (40x + 20y)$ and we have \n\nSince in this case the total amount spent may be upto $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 120. Note that the statement (2) consists of two statements \n\nStatement (3) is not an equation, i.e., it is an inequality while statement (4) is an equation. \n\nDefinition 1 Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbol $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ , $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ , $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ or $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ form an inequality. \n\nStatements such as (1), (2) and (3) above are inequalities. \n\n$3 < 5$ ; $7 > 5$ are the examples of numerical inequalities while \n\n$x < 5; y > 2; x \\geq 3, y \\leq 4$ are some examples of literal inequalities. \n\n$3 < 5 < 7$ (read as 5 is greater than 3 and less than 7), $3 \\leq x < 5$ (read as $x$ is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 5) and $2 < y \\leq 4$ are the examples of double inequalities. \n\nSome more examples of inequalities are: \n\nInequalities (5), (6), (9), (10) and (14) are strict inequalities while inequalities (7), (8), (11), (12), and (13) are slack inequalities.

Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this inequality is $30x$ and right hand side (RHS) is 200. Therefore, we have \n\nFor $x = 0$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ $(0) = 0 < 200$ (R.H.S.), which is true. \n\nFor $x = 1$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (1) $= 30 < 200$ (R.H.S.), which is true. \n\nFor $x = 2$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (2) $= 60 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 3$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (3) $= 90 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 4$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (4) $= 120 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 5$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (5) $= 150 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 6$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (6) $= 180 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 7$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (7) $= 210 < 200$ , which is false. \n\nIn the above situation, we find that the values of $x$ , which makes the above inequality a true statement, are $0,1,2,3,4,5,6$ . These values of $x$ , which make above inequality a true statement, are called solutions of inequality and the set $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ is called its solution set. \n\nThus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable which makes it a true statement. \n\nWe have found the solutions of the above inequality by trial and error method which is not very efficient. Obviously, this method is time consuming and sometimes not feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities. Before that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and follow them as rules while solving the inequalities. \n\nYou will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules: \n\nRule 1 Equal numbers may",

Here, 30 is the cost per packet, and the product 30x gives the total expenditure. The inequality states that the total cost must be strictly less than ₹200, reflecting the constraint that Ravi cannot exceed his budget. The variable x is a non-negative integer in practical terms, as partial packets cannot be purchased. The inequality uses the less than symbol '<', indicating a strict upper bound on expenditure. This inequality is foundational in understanding linear inequalities, illustrating how real-world constraints translate into mathematical expressions. It relates to the broader discussion on linear inequalities by exemplifying how inequalities differ from equations and how they model limitations in resource allocation problems.

Here, x and y denote the quantities of two different items (registers and pens) that Reshma intends to purchase, with costs 40 and 20 units of currency respectively. The inequality states that the total expenditure on these items must not exceed 120 units. Mathematically, this is a linear inequality because it involves a linear combination of variables constrained by a less than or equal to (≤) relation. The variables x and y are non-negative integers in the practical context, representing countable items. The inequality uses addition and scalar multiplication operations. This inequality models a budget constraint in an economic or consumer choice context, illustrating how limited resources restrict possible combinations of goods. It is foundational in linear programming and optimization problems, where feasible regions are defined by such inequalities. The equation relates to the broader discussion of linear inequalities by exemplifying how real-world constraints translate into mathematical inequalities, distinguishing them from equations by the inequality sign. It also demonstrates the practical application of inequalities in problem-solving across various fields such as economics, business, and resource management.",

The first expression is a strict linear inequality 40x + 20y < 120, indicating that the total cost of x registers and y pens is strictly less than 120 units of currency (denoted by τ). The second expression is a linear equation 40x + 20y = 120, representing the exact expenditure limit. Variables x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of registers and pens purchased. The operations involved are linear combinations and inequality/equality relations. This system models budget constraints in a purchasing scenario, illustrating how inequalities generalize equations to represent feasible spending limits rather than exact amounts. The inequality defines a feasible region of solutions where total cost is under budget, while the equation defines the boundary of this region. This relates to the broader study of linear inequalities and their solution sets, which are fundamental in optimization, economics, and resource allocation problems. The physical significance lies in modeling real-world constraints where exact equality is rare, and inequalities better capture permissible ranges. The system exemplifies the transition from equations to inequalities in problem-solving, highlighting the importance of inequalities in representing realistic conditions and decision-making frameworks.",

Mathematically, it describes the set of values of \\( x \\) for which the quadratic polynomial \\( a x^{2} + b x + c \\) takes strictly positive values. The variable \\( x \\) typically denotes a real number, and the inequality involves polynomial expressions and the strict inequality operator \">\". This inequality is a nonlinear inequality, contrasting with the linear inequalities discussed earlier in the chapter. The quadratic form introduces curvature, and its solution set depends on the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^{2} - 4ac \\). If \\( \\Delta < 0 \\), the quadratic does not intersect the \\( x \\)-axis, and the sign of \\( a \\) determines whether the inequality holds for all real \\( x \\) or none. If \\( \\Delta \\geq 0 \\), the roots partition the real line into intervals where the quadratic is positive or negative, and the solution set is the union of intervals where the inequality holds. This inequality is fundamental in algebra and calculus, with applications in optimization, physics (e.g., potential energy functions), and economics (e.g., profit functions). Within the broader context of the chapter on inequalities, this equation exemplifies the transition from linear to nonlinear inequalities, highlighting the increased complexity in solution methods and graphical interpretation. It also connects to the study of polynomial functions and their sign analysis, which is essential for understanding more advanced inequality problems.",

The first inequality, 3 > 2, is a basic numerical inequality establishing that 3 is greater than 2. The second inequality, -3 < -2, shows the reversed order when comparing negative numbers. The third inequality, -8 < -7, is another example of ordering on the negative number line. The key operation demonstrated is multiplication of both sides of an inequality by a negative number (-2), which reverses the inequality sign: multiplying -8 < -7 by -2 yields 16 > 14. This exemplifies the rule that multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the inequality direction. Variables here are specific numeric values illustrating the principle rather than symbolic variables. The mathematical operations include inequality relations and multiplication. The context is the study of linear inequalities and their solution rules, particularly the sign reversal rule when multiplying by negative numbers. This principle is foundational in algebra and critical for correctly solving inequalities. It relates to the broader framework of solving linear inequalities in one variable, ensuring valid transformations while preserving solution sets. Practical applications include solving inequalities in economics, physics, and optimization problems where constraints involve inequalities. This example concretely demonstrates the theoretical significance of sign reversal in inequality manipulation, reinforcing the rules stated earlier in the text.",

Here, $x$ denotes the number of packets of rice, a variable constrained to non-negative integers due to the physical context.

    "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n1 0 <   x <   1 9\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The inequality 10 < x < 19 represents a strict double inequality defining the range of values that the variable x can take. Mathematically, it means that x is a real number strictly greater than 10 and strictly less than 19. In the context of the surrounding content, x denotes the smaller of two consecutive odd natural numbers both greater than 10. The inequality arises from the problem constraints that the sum of these two numbers is less than 40, leading to the upper bound x < 19, while the problem also requires x > 10. The operations involved include inequality relations and the concept of consecutive odd numbers expressed as x and x + 2. This inequality is fundamental in number theory and algebra for defining solution sets within bounded intervals. It relates to other inequalities in the text by illustrating how to solve compound inequalities and apply them to discrete number sets. Practically, it helps identify all valid values of x that satisfy the problem's conditions, enabling enumeration of possible pairs of consecutive odd numbers. This equation exemplifies the use of inequalities to constrain variables in problem-solving and connects to broader discussions on solving linear inequalities and interpreting solution sets on the real number line.",

    "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n1 1 - 5 x \\leq 1\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The inequality \\(11 - 5x \\leq 1\\) represents a linear inequality in one variable \\(x\\). Mathematically, it expresses a constraint on \\(x\\) such that when multiplied by \\(-5\\) and added to 11, the result does not exceed 1. Here, \\(x\\) is a real number variable, consistent with the context of solving linear inequalities on real numbers. The operations involved include scalar multiplication, addition, and the inequality relation \\(\\leq\\) (less than or equal to). This inequality can be rearranged by subtracting 11 from both sides to yield \\(-5x \\leq -10\\), and then dividing both sides by \\(-5\\) (noting the inequality direction reverses due to division by a negative number), resulting in \\(x \\geq 2\\). This solution set describes all real numbers \\(x\\) greater than or equal to 2. Within the broader context of the exercises, this inequality exemplifies the process of solving linear inequalities, a fundamental skill in algebra. It also relates to the system of inequalities discussed in the surrounding content, where solutions are often represented on the number line. The physical or theoretical significance lies in modeling constraints or conditions in applied problems, such as resource limits or boundary conditions. Practically, such inequalities are used in optimization, economics, and engineering to define feasible regions. This equation fits into the broader framework of understanding and manipulating inequalities to find solution sets and interpret them graphically or numerically.",

Here, the variable F denotes temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and the expression (5/9)(F - 32) converts Fahrenheit to Celsius according to the standard conversion formula C = (5/9)(F - 32). The inequality bounds the Celsius temperature between 30 and 35 degrees, indicating a temperature range constraint. Mathematically, this involves scalar multiplication and subtraction within the linear function converting F to C. The inequality is solved by isolating F, multiplying all parts by 9/5, and adding 32, yielding the Fahrenheit range corresponding to the Celsius bounds. This equation is situated in the context of temperature conversion and range determination, illustrating how to translate constraints from one unit system to another. It exemplifies the use of compound inequalities to express and solve real-world constraints, particularly in physical sciences and engineering where temperature control is critical. The equation relates to other inequalities in the text by demonstrating the method of solving compound inequalities and applying linear transformations. Practically, it is used to determine acceptable temperature ranges in Fahrenheit when Celsius limits are specified, such as in chemical experiments or environmental controls. This equation thus bridges theoretical inequality solving with practical unit conversion and constraint satisfaction within the broader framework of applied mathematics and problem-solving.",

Mathematically, it is an affine transformation mapping a temperature value in degrees Celsius to its equivalent in degrees Fahrenheit. Here, \\(C\\) is the independent variable denoting temperature in Celsius, and \\(F\\) is the dependent variable denoting temperature in Fahrenheit. The operation involves multiplication by the factor \\(\\frac{9}{5}\\) (or 1.8), followed by an addition of 32, which accounts for the offset between the two scales. This formula is derived from the linear relationship between the freezing and boiling points of water in the two scales: 0°C corresponds to 32°F, and 100°C corresponds to 212°F. The equation is fundamental in thermodynamics and everyday temperature conversions, enabling translation of temperature measurements between metric and imperial systems. In the surrounding context, it is used to determine the Fahrenheit temperature range corresponding to a given Celsius range (30°C to 35°C), illustrating practical application in experimental conditions requiring temperature control. This equation relates to inequalities and interval solutions discussed earlier, as it facilitates converting constraints expressed in Celsius to equivalent constraints in Fahrenheit, thus integrating algebraic manipulation with real-world measurement systems. Its theoretical significance lies in exemplifying linear functions and their use in unit conversions, while practically it is essential in scientific, engineering, and meteorological contexts where temperature data interchange is necessary.",

    "content": "PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS \n\nEvery body of discovery is mathematical in form because there is no other guidance we can have - DARWIN \n\n6.1 Introduction \n\nSuppose you have a suitcase with a number lock. The number lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will \n\nenable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact, these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques. \n\n6.2 Fundamental Principle of Counting \n\nLet us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ pairs of a pant and a shirt. \n\nLet us name the three pants as $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3$ and the two shirts as $\\mathrm{S}_1, \\mathrm{S}_2$ . Then, these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1. \n\nLet us consider another problem of the same type. \n\nSabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes and 2 water bottles. In how many ways can she carry these items (choosing one each). \n\nA school bag can be chosen in 2 different ways. After a school bag is chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3 different ways. Hence, there are $2 \\times 3 = 6$ pairs of school bag and a tiffin box. For each of these pairs a water bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. \n\nHence, there are $6 \\times 2 = 12$ different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to school. If we name the 2 school bags as $\\mathrm{B}_1, \\mathrm{B}_2$ , the three tiffin boxes as $\\mathrm{T}_1, \\mathrm{T}_2, \\mathrm{T}_3$ and the two water bottles as $\\mathrm{W}_1, \\mathrm{W}_2$ , these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2. \n\nIn fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication principle, which states that \n\n\"If an event can occur in $m$ different ways, following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is $m \\times n$ . \n\nThe above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows: \n\n'If an event can occur in $m$ different ways, following which",

For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows: \n\n'If an event can occur in $m$ different ways, following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, following which a third event can occur in $p$ different ways, then the total number of occurrence to 'the events in the given order is $m \\times n \\times p$ .' \n\nIn the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: \n\nIn the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: \n\nHere, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of different ways of the occurrence of the events in this chosen order. \n\nExample 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed. \n\nSolution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places \n\n□□□□by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3 different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the 4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ .

The first place can be filled in $n$ ways; following which, the second place can be filled in $(n - 1)$ ways, following which the third place can be filled in $(n - 2)$ ways,..., the $r$ th place can be filled in $(n - (r - 1))$ ways. Therefore, the number of ways of filling in $r$ vacant places in succession is $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\ldots (n - (r - 1))$ or $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\ldots (n - r + 1)$ \n\nThis expression for ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to reduce the size of this expression. The symbol $n!$ (read as factorial $n$ or $n$ factorial) comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually $n!$ means. \n\n6.3.2 Factorial notation The notation $n!$ represents the product of first $n$ natural numbers, i.e., the product $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\ldots \\times (n - 1) \\times n$ is denoted as $n!$ . We read this symbol as ' $n$ factorial'. Thus, $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\ldots \\times (n - 1) \\times n = n!$ \n\nWe define $0! = 1$ \n\nWe can write $5! = 5 \\times 4! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2!$ \n\nClearly, for a natural number $n$ \n\nand so on. \n\nExample 5 Evaluate (i) 5!

Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with 5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be $^6\\mathrm{P}_6 = 6!$ . Corresponding to each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E taken all at a time. Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of permutations $= 6! \\times 3! = 4320$ . \n\n(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never together, we first have to find all possible arrangements of 8 letters taken all at a time, which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number of permutations in which the vowels are always together. \n\nTherefore, the required number $8! - 6! \\times 3! = 6! (7 \\times 8 - 6)$ \n\nExample 15 In how many ways can 4 red, 3 yellow and 2 green discs be arranged in a row if the discs of the same colour are indistinguishable? \n\nSolution Total number of discs are $4 + 3 + 2 = 9$ . Out of 9 discs, 4 are of the first kind \n\n(red), 3 are of the second kind (yellow) and 2 are of the third kind (green). \n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements $\\frac{9!}{4!3!2!} = 1260$ . \n\nExample 16 Find the number of arrangements of the letters of the word INDEPENDENCE. In how many of these arrangements, \n\nSolution There are 12 letters, of which N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times and D appears 2 times and the rest are all different. Therefore \n\nThe required number of arrangements $= \\frac{12!}{3!4!2!} = 1663200$ \n\n(i) Let us fix $\\mathrm{P}$ at the extreme left position, we, then, count the arrangements of the remaining 11 letters. Therefore, the required number of words starting with $\\mathrm{P}$ \n\n(ii) There are 5 vowels in the given word, which are 4 Es and 1 I. Since, they have to always occur together, we treat them as a single object EEEI for the time being. This single object together with 7 remaining objects will account for 8 objects. These 8 objects, in which there are 3Ns and 2 Ds, can be rearranged in 8! 3! 2! ways. Corresponding to each of these arrangements, the 5 vowels E, E, E, E and I can be rearranged in 5! 4! ways. Therefore, by multiplication principle, the required number of arrangements \n\n(iii) The required number of arrangements $=$ the total number of arrangements (without any restriction) - the number of arrangements where all the vowels occur together. \n\n(iv) Let us fix I and P at the extreme ends (I at the left end",

A team consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can we do so? Is the team of X and Y different from the team of Y and X? Here, order is not important. In fact, there are only 3 possible ways in which the team could be constructed. \n\nThese are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3). \n\nHere, each selection is called a combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time. In a combination, the order is not important. \n\nNow consider some more illustrations. \n\nTwelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and Y with X will not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time. \n\nSeven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different things taken 2 at a time. \n\nNow, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time, denoted by ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . \n\nSuppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here, AB and BA are the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., $^4\\mathrm{C}_2 = 6$ . \n\nCorresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as 2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of permutations $= ^{4}\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\times 2!$ . \n\nOn the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at a time $= 4\\mathrm{P}_2$ . \n\nTherefore \n\nNow, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E.

    "content": "In the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita, asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C., gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra. Bhaskaracharya (born 1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and combinations under the name Anka Pasha in his famous work Lilavati. In addition to the general formulae for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ and $^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ already provided by Mahavira, Bhaskaracharya gives several important theorems and results concerning the subject. \n\nOutside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its humble beginnings in China in the famous book I-King (Book of changes). It is difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations. \n\nSome Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and combinations in studying astronomy. Rabbi ben Ezra, for instance, determined the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra did not know \n\nthe formula for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . However, he was aware that $^n\\mathrm{C}_r = ^n\\mathrm{C}_{n - r}$ for specific values $n$ and $r$ . In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson, another Hebrew writer came up with the formulae for $^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ , $^n\\mathrm{P}_n$ and the general formula for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . \n\nThe first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, Jacob Bernoulli (1654 - 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.",

The composition centers on Bernoulli's bust, showing him from the chest up, facing slightly to the viewer's left. He is dressed in period-appropriate attire, including a dark robe or cloak with a white collar, indicative of scholarly or academic status. The background is plain and dark, which emphasizes Bernoulli's face and upper body, drawing attention to his thoughtful expression and distinguished features such as a high forehead, long hair, and a neatly trimmed beard. The lighting is soft and focused on his face, creating subtle shadows that enhance the three-dimensionality of the portrait. The visual style is realistic with fine detail, typical of oil paintings from the Baroque period. There are no additional objects, text, or symbols within the image itself. The caption identifies the subject as 'Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705)', linking the image to the historical context of mathematical discovery and foundational principles in permutations and combinations discussed in the surrounding content. This portrait serves as a visual homage to Bernoulli's contributions to mathematics, particularly in probability and combinatorics, reinforcing the chapter's theme of fundamental counting principles.",

The layout is a three-level tree diagram. The first level shows two nodes labeled B1 and B2, representing two different school bags. Each of these nodes branches into three nodes labeled T1, T2, and T3, representing three different tiffin boxes. Each tiffin box node further branches into two nodes labeled W1 and W2, representing two different water bottles. The diagram visually enumerates all possible combinations of choosing one school bag, one tiffin box, and one water bottle, resulting in 12 unique paths from the root to the leaves. The nodes are connected by straight lines indicating the selection sequence: first a bag, then a tiffin box, then a water bottle. The text labels are clear and use a serif font, with each item name in black on a white background. The diagram uses a simple black-and-white color scheme with no additional colors or shading. The image is clean, with ample white space around the nodes and lines, enhancing readability. This visual representation directly supports the surrounding textual explanation of the multiplication principle in counting, concretely demonstrating how the total number of combinations (2 x 3 x 2 = 12) is derived without listing all possibilities manually.

Mathematically, it expresses the number of ways to arrange r objects chosen from n distinct objects without repetition, denoted as ${}^nP_r = n(n-1)(n-2)\\ldots (n-r+1)$. Here, 'r vacant places' symbolizes the positions to be filled, and the multiplication principle is applied to count the total permutations by filling each place one after another with decreasing available choices. The variables n and r are integers with 0 < r ≤ n, where n is the total number of distinct objects and r is the number of positions to fill. The operations involved are sequential multiplication of decreasing integers starting from n down to (n-r+1). This concept is foundational in combinatorics, particularly in permutation theory, and is closely related to factorial notation, which simplifies the expression to ${}^nP_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$. The equation is significant in enumerating ordered arrangements in various fields such as probability, statistics, computer science, and operations research. It underpins the calculation of permutations in problems involving arrangement, ordering, and selection without repetition, and serves as a basis for more complex combinatorial constructs like combinations and permutations with repetition. Within the broader discussion, this equation formalizes the intuitive counting methods previously illustrated by examples and leads to the introduction of factorial notation for compact representation and easier computation.",

The right-hand side is a product of $r$ consecutive descending integers starting from $n$, reflecting the sequential selection of objects where each choice reduces the available pool by one. This formula is equivalent to the factorial expression ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$, which is often used for computational convenience. The equation is fundamental in combinatorics, particularly in counting ordered arrangements (permutations) where order matters and repetition is not allowed. It underpins the calculation of permutations in various contexts such as arranging letters, selecting officers from a group, or forming words from a set of characters. The formula also connects to binomial coefficients and combinations, as permutations can be viewed as combinations multiplied by the number of ways to order the selected elements. Within the broader discussion, this equation provides a more intuitive and computationally efficient way to calculate permutations compared to factorial division, facilitating problem-solving in discrete mathematics and probability theory.",

Mathematically, it states that the number of ways to arrange zero objects from a set of $n$ objects is exactly one, which corresponds to the empty arrangement or doing nothing. Here, $n$ is a non-negative integer representing the total number of distinct objects, and the subscript $0$ indicates the number of objects chosen for permutation. The factorial function $n!$ denotes the product of all positive integers up to $n$, with the convention $0! = 1$. The equation uses the permutation formula ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ specialized at $r=0$. This expression is fundamental in combinatorics, particularly in counting problems involving arrangements without repetition. It confirms that the permutation formula is valid even for the edge case $r=0$, ensuring mathematical consistency and completeness. The physical or theoretical significance lies in establishing a base case for recursive or combinatorial arguments, and it aligns with the principle that there is exactly one way to select and arrange nothing. This equation relates directly to the broader discussion on permutations, factorial operations, and combinatorial identities presented in the surrounding content, which includes factorial evaluations, permutation counts, and their applications in counting arrangements and selections. Practically, it underpins algorithms and formulas in probability, statistics, and discrete mathematics where boundary conditions must be handled rigorously.

Mathematically, it involves multiplication and subtraction operations on positive integers. The first term, 4 × 5 × 6, computes the product of three consecutive integers starting from 4, yielding 120. The second term, 4 × 5, is the product of two integers, yielding 20. Subtracting the second product from the first results in 100. Within the surrounding context, which discusses permutations and combinatorial arrangements, this equation likely represents a step in counting or enumerating specific arrangements or permutations by inclusion-exclusion or by subtracting unwanted cases from total cases. The numbers 4, 5, and 6 may correspond to counts of objects or positions in permutations, and the subtraction removes overcounted or invalid configurations. This arithmetic manipulation exemplifies how factorial and permutation expressions can be simplified into explicit integer calculations to find the number of valid permutations or arrangements. The equation's significance lies in its role as a concrete numerical example illustrating combinatorial reasoning and the use of basic arithmetic operations to solve permutation problems. It relates to the broader framework of counting principles, factorial calculations, and permutation formulas discussed in the surrounding text, demonstrating practical application of these concepts in enumerating arrangements with constraints.",

Here, $n$ is a positive integer greater than 4, representing the total number of distinct objects or elements considered in permutation problems. The equation arises from simplifying the equality of two permutation expressions, specifically ${}^nP_5 = 42 \times {}^nP_3$, where ${}^nP_r = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ denotes the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time.

Solving this quadratic equation yields possible values of $n$ that satisfy the permutation equality, with the physically meaningful solution being $n=10$ since $n$ must be positive and greater than 4. This equation exemplifies the use of algebraic manipulation to solve combinatorial problems and connects factorial-based permutation formulas to polynomial equations. It also illustrates the interplay between discrete counting principles and algebraic methods, which is fundamental in combinatorics and its applications in probability, statistics, and computer science.

Here, r is an integer parameter representing the number of elements chosen in permutations. The factorial expressions denote permutations: specifically, nPr = n! / (n - r)!, which counts the number of ordered arrangements of r elements from a set of n distinct elements. The left side, 5 × 4Pr, can be interpreted as 5 times the number of permutations of 4 elements taken r at a time, while the right side, 6 × 5P(r-1), is 6 times the number of permutations of 5 elements taken (r-1) at a time. The equation equates these two scaled permutation counts, implying a combinatorial equality or balance between these two counting scenarios. This type of equation arises in combinatorial problems where permutations with constraints or weighted counts are compared or equated to find unknown parameters (here, r). The factorial and permutation functions are fundamental in enumerative combinatorics, and the equation's solution provides the value of r that satisfies this balance. In the broader context of the surrounding content, which deals with permutations and combinations, this equation exemplifies the use of permutation formulas to solve for unknown parameters in counting problems. It also illustrates the manipulation of factorial expressions and the use of algebraic techniques to solve combinatorial equations. Practical applications include problems in probability, arrangement, and selection where the number of ways to order or select items under certain conditions must be determined. The equation is a specific instance of equating two permutation-based expressions, highlighting the interplay between different permutation counts and their scaling factors in combinatorial analysis.",

    "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\n= \\frac {8 !}{3 ! 2 !} \\times \\frac {5 !}{4 !} = 1 6 8 0 0\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: This equation calculates the number of distinct arrangements of letters in a word with repeated characters, specifically applied to a scenario where the word contains 8 letters with repetitions of certain letters. The numerator 8! represents the factorial of the total number of letters, accounting for all possible permutations if all letters were distinct. The denominators 3! and 2! correspond to the factorials of the counts of repeated letters, correcting for overcounting permutations that arise from indistinguishable letters. The second fraction, 5!/4!, simplifies to 5, indicating an additional factor related to permutations of a subset of letters or vowels within the word, possibly accounting for arrangements of vowels treated as a single object or subgroup. Multiplying these two fractions yields 16800, the total number of distinct arrangements under the given constraints. This equation is situated within the combinatorial framework of permutations with repetition, a fundamental concept in enumerative combinatorics. It is particularly relevant in problems involving arrangements of letters in words where some letters repeat, such as the word INDEPENDENCE or similar examples discussed in the surrounding context. The equation exemplifies the use of the division principle to handle indistinguishable objects and the multiplication principle to combine independent permutation counts. Practically, it aids in counting unique sequences in linguistics, coding theory, and probability calculations where order and repetition matter. Within the broader discussion, this equation illustrates the systematic approach to counting permutations with repeated elements and subsets, reinforcing the foundational techniques of permutation enumeration in discrete mathematics.",

This calculation arises in the context of counting permutations of letters in the word 'INDEPENDENCE' under certain constraints. Specifically, 1663200 represents the total number of distinct arrangements of the 12 letters accounting for repeated letters (N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times, D appears 2 times), calculated as 12!/(3!4!2!). The term 168000 corresponds to the number of arrangements where all vowels (E and I) occur together, treated as a single object, and then expanded by the permutations of vowels themselves. The subtraction yields the number of arrangements where vowels do not all occur together. The variables implicitly represent counts of permutations and arrangements, factorial operations, and combinatorial principles such as the multiplication principle and the concept of treating grouped letters as single entities.

Here, ${}^4 P_2$ denotes the number of permutations of 4 distinct objects taken 2 at a time, while ${}^4 C_2$ represents the number of combinations of 4 distinct objects taken 2 at a time. The factorial notation $n!$ denotes the product of all positive integers up to $n$. The term $2!$ accounts for the number of ways to arrange 2 objects within each combination, reflecting that permutations consider order whereas combinations do not. The equation mathematically formalizes that permutations can be obtained by multiplying combinations by the factorial of the number of selected objects, $r!$. This relationship is foundational in combinatorics, linking the concepts of ordered and unordered selections. Variables: $n=4$ is the total number of distinct objects, $r=2$ is the number of objects chosen. The operations include factorial calculation, division, and multiplication. The equation arises in contexts such as counting arrangements of letters or forming teams where order matters (permutations) versus where order does not matter (combinations). It underpins the theorem ${}^n P_r = {}^n C_r \\times r!$ and is critical in probability, statistics, and discrete mathematics.

Mathematically, ^{13}C_1 = 13, so the product simplifies to 13^4. The variables here are the binomial coefficients ^{13}C_1, where 13 is the total number of objects (e.g., cards in a suit) and 1 is the number chosen. The operation used is the multiplication of combinations, reflecting the counting principle for independent selections. In the context of card selection, this equation calculates the total number of ways to select one card from each of four suits (diamonds, clubs, spades, hearts), each having 13 cards. This is a direct application of combinatorics in probability and counting problems, illustrating how to combine independent choices multiplicatively. The equation relates to the broader discussion of combinations and counting principles, emphasizing the use of binomial coefficients to solve practical problems in card games and committee selections. It also exemplifies the multiplication principle in combinatorics, where the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of ways to perform each independent selection.",

The equation uses the binomial coefficient notation, where ^nC_r represents the number of combinations of selecting r elements from n elements without regard to order. The terms correspond to all possible distributions of boys and girls in the team that satisfy the condition: (1 boy and 4 girls), (2 boys and 3 girls), (3 boys and 2 girls), and (4 boys and 1 girl). Each term is a product of two binomial coefficients, representing the number of ways to choose boys and girls respectively. The summation of these products gives the total number of valid teams. The equation employs combinatorial operations and the principle of addition to account for mutually exclusive cases. This combinatorial approach is fundamental in discrete mathematics and probability theory, often applied in problems involving selection, arrangement, and partitioning of sets. The physical or theoretical significance lies in enumerating feasible groupings under constraints, which is essential in statistics, game theory, and resource allocation. The equation relates to other combinatorial expressions in the context, such as selecting cards or letters, highlighting the consistent use of combinations in counting problems. Practically, it can be used in team formation, experimental design, and any scenario requiring counting of subsets with specific composition constraints. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the application of combinations to solve real-world selection problems, reinforcing the understanding of binomial coefficients and their additive properties in combinatorics.",

The notation ^nC_r denotes the binomial coefficient, representing the number of combinations of r elements chosen from n elements without regard to order.

    "content": "BINOMIAL THEOREM \n\nMathematics is a most exact science and its conclusions are capable of absolute proofs. - C.P. STEINMETZ \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to find the squares and cubes of binomials like $a + b$ and $a - b$ . Using them, we could evaluate the numerical values of numbers like $(98)^2 = (100 - 2)^2$ , $(999)^3 = (1000 - 1)^3$ , etc. However, for higher powers like $(98)^5$ , $(101)^6$ , etc., the calculations become difficult by using repeated multiplication. This difficulty was overcome by a theorem known as binomial theorem. It gives an easier way to expand $(a + b)^n$ , where $n$ is an integer or a rational number. In this Chapter, we study binomial theorem for positive integral indices only. \n\n7.2 Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Indices \n\nLet us have a look at the following identities done earlier: \n\nIn these expansions, we observe that \n\nWe now arrange the coefficients in these expansions as follows (Fig 7.1): \n\nDo we observe any pattern in this table that will help us to write the next row? Yes we do. It can be seen that the addition of 1's in the row for index 1 gives rise to 2 in the row for index 2. The addition of 1, 2 and 2, 1 in the row for index 2, gives rise to 3 and 3 in the row for index 3 and so on. Also, 1 is present at the beginning and at the end of each row. This can be continued till any index of our interest. \n\nWe can extend the pattern given in Fig 7.2 by writing a few more rows. \n\nPascal's Triangle \n\nThe structure given in Fig 7.2 looks like a triangle with 1 at the top vertex and running down the two slanting sides. This array of numbers is known as Pascal's triangle, after the name of French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is also known as Meru Prastara by Pingla. \n\nExpansions for the higher powers of a binomial are also possible by using Pascal's triangle. Let us expand $(2x + 3y)^5$ by using Pascal's triangle. The row for index 5 is \n\n1 5 10 10 5 1 \n\nUsing this row and our observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we get \n\nNow, if we want to find the expansion of $(2x + 3y)^{12}$ , we are first required to get the row for index 12. This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle till index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become more difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers. \n\nWe thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for any power without writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle, that come before the row of the desired index. \n\nFor this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite the numbers in the Pascal's triangle. We know that ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$ , $0 \\leq r \\leq n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer. Also, ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_0 = 1 = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_n$ \n\nThe Pascal's triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3) \n\nObserving this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal",

For example, for the index 7 the row would be \n\nThus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have \n\nAn expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say $n$ can now be visualised using these observations. We are now in a position to write the expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index. \n\n7.2.1 Binomial theorem for any positive integer $n$ , \n\nProof The proof is obtained by applying principle of mathematical induction. \n\nLet the given statement be \n\nFor $n = 1$ , we have \n\nThus, P (1) is true. \n\nSuppose $\\mathrm{P}(k)$ is true for some positive integer $k$ , i.e. \n\n$(a + b)^{k} = {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{0}a^{k} + {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{1}a^{k - 1}b + {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{2}a^{k - 2}b^{2} + \\ldots +{}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{k}b^{k}$ 1 \n\nWe shall prove that $\\mathrm{P}(k + 1)$ is also true, i.e., \n\n[by actual multiplication] \n\n(by using ${}^{\\mathrm{k + 1}}\\mathrm{C}_0 = 1$ , ${}^k\\mathrm{C}_r + {}^k\\mathrm{C}_{r - 1} = {}^k +1\\mathrm{C}_r$ and ${}^k\\mathrm{C}_k = 1 = {}^k +1\\mathrm{C}_{k + 1}$ ) \n\nThus, it has been proved that $\\mathrm{P}(k + 1)$ is true whenever $\\mathrm{P}(k)$ is true. Therefore, by principle of mathematical induction, $\\mathrm{P}(n)$ is true for every positive integer $n$ . \n\nWe illustrate this theorem by expanding $(x + 2)^6$ : \n\nThus $(x + 2)^6 = x^6 + 12x^5 + 60x^4 + 160x^3 + 240x^2 + 192x + 64$ . \n\nObservations \n\n1.

This triangular arrangement is also found in the work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ , for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7$ and Oughtred (1631) gave them for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10$ . The arithmetic triangle, popularly known as Pascal's triangle and similar to the Meru-Prastara of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) in 1665. \n\nThe present form of the binomial theorem for integral values of $n$ appeared in Trate du triangle arithmetic, written by Pascal and published posthumously in 1665.",

His hair is shoulder-length, wavy, and brown, framing a pale, serious face with a contemplative expression. The background is dark and plain, focusing attention on Pascal's face and upper body. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the textures of his clothing and the subtle details of his facial features. The portrait is painted in a realistic style typical of Baroque-era European art, emphasizing naturalism and depth. The image is relevant to the surrounding content as it visually introduces Blaise Pascal, after whom Pascal's triangle is named, a key concept in the binomial theorem chapter.

Mathematically, these expansions express the power of a binomial sum as a sum of terms involving powers of a and b multiplied by binomial coefficients. The variables a and b are arbitrary quantities, typically real or complex numbers, and n is a non-negative integer indicating the power to which the binomial is raised. The operations involved include exponentiation, multiplication, and addition. Each term in the expansion corresponds to a specific binomial coefficient, which can be derived from Pascal's triangle, reflecting combinatorial counts of selecting terms. This equation set is foundational in algebra and combinatorics, illustrating how powers of sums can be expanded systematically without direct multiplication. The expansions have theoretical significance in polynomial theory, combinatorics, and probability, and practical applications in numerical computations, algebraic simplifications, and series expansions. Within the broader context of the binomial theorem chapter, these expansions serve as concrete examples demonstrating the pattern of coefficients and terms that lead to the general binomial theorem formula for positive integral indices. They also connect to Pascal's triangle, which provides a combinatorial method to determine coefficients efficiently.",

Mathematically, it expresses the fifth power of a binomial sum as a sum of terms involving powers of each variable multiplied by binomial coefficients. Here, the variables are x and y, which are indeterminates or real numbers, and the constants 2 and 3 are coefficients multiplying these variables inside the binomial. The expansion uses the binomial coefficients from the 5th row of Pascal's triangle: 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. Each term is constructed as C(5, r) * (2x)^(5-r) * (3y)^r for r = 0 to 5, where C(5, r) = 5!/(r!(5-r)!) are the combination numbers. The equation demonstrates the application of the binomial theorem to simplify the computation of powers of binomials without repeated multiplication. The operations involved include exponentiation, multiplication, and addition. The expansion also shows the distributive property of multiplication over addition and the use of factorial-based combinatorial coefficients. This equation is fundamental in algebra and combinatorics, illustrating how Pascal's triangle relates to binomial coefficients and polynomial expansions. It has practical applications in probability theory, algebraic computations, and numerical methods where polynomial expansions are required. Within the broader context of the chapter, this equation exemplifies the use of Pascal's triangle and combinations to efficiently expand binomials raised to positive integral powers, avoiding the cumbersome process of manual multiplication and highlighting the combinatorial structure underlying polynomial expansions.",

The triangle is composed of rows of numbers, each row corresponding to a non-negative integer index starting from 0 at the top vertex. The topmost row contains a single number '1'. Each subsequent row starts and ends with '1', and the interior numbers are the sum of the two numbers directly above it from the previous row, illustrating the additive pattern characteristic of Pascal's triangle. The numbers are arranged in a centered alignment forming a symmetrical triangle. The rows shown extend at least up to index 7, with numbers such as 1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1 visible in the 7th row. The numbers are displayed in a clear, black font on a white background, ensuring high contrast and readability. The image visually encodes the combinatorial formula for binomial coefficients, where each number corresponds to the value of nCr for given n and r. This visual representation directly supports the surrounding text's explanation of how Pascal's triangle can be used to find binomial expansions without enumerating all previous rows, emphasizing the connection between the triangle and combinations. The image is a static, two-dimensional diagram without additional graphical embellishments or color coding, focusing purely on the numerical pattern and its mathematical significance.",

The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are arbitrary quantities (which can be numbers, variables, or expressions), and \\(k\\) is a non-negative integer. The equation uses summation of terms with decreasing powers of \\(a\\) and increasing powers of \\(b\\), reflecting the combinatorial structure of the binomial coefficients. This formula is a direct consequence of the binomial theorem and is fundamental in combinatorics, algebra, and probability theory. It provides a closed-form expression for expanding binomials raised to any positive integer power without enumerating Pascal's triangle rows explicitly. The equation is proven using mathematical induction, relying on the recursive property of binomial coefficients: \\({}^kC_r + {}^kC_{r-1} = {}^{k+1}C_r\\). This relationship connects the current expansion to the previous one, establishing the inductive step. The binomial theorem and this expansion have broad applications including polynomial expansions, probability distributions (e.g., binomial distribution), and series approximations. In the broader context of the surrounding content, this equation formalizes the method to expand \\((a+b)^n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\), streamlining the process beyond manual construction of Pascal's triangle and enabling algebraic manipulation and computation of binomial expansions efficiently.",

Mathematically, it states that \\(2^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k}\\), where \\({n \\choose k}\\) denotes the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. The variables involved are n, a non-negative integer indicating the power and the size of the set, and k, the index of summation ranging from 0 to n. The binomial coefficients \\({n \\choose k}\\) are defined as \\(\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\). This identity is a direct consequence of the binomial theorem, which expands \\((a+b)^n\\) into a sum involving these coefficients. Setting \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\) in the binomial theorem yields this equation, highlighting the total number of subsets of an n-element set (since each element can be either included or excluded, giving 2 choices per element, hence \\(2^n\\) subsets). The equation is fundamental in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra, serving as a cornerstone for counting arguments and expansions. It relates to other concepts in the context such as the binomial theorem expansions for expressions like \\((x - y)^n\\) and practical computations of powers by binomial expansion. Its theoretical significance lies in connecting algebraic expansions with combinatorial interpretations, and practically, it underpins algorithms in computer science, statistical calculations, and discrete mathematics. Within the broader discussion, this identity supports the understanding of binomial expansions and their applications in evaluating powers, proving divisibility properties, and solving exercises involving polynomial expansions.",

Mathematically, it states that (1 + a)^n can be expanded as the sum of terms involving binomial coefficients ^nC_k multiplied by powers of a, from k=0 to k=n. Here, n is a non-negative integer representing the exponent, a is a variable or constant term, and ^nC_k denotes the binomial coefficient, defined as n!/(k!(n-k)!), representing the number of ways to choose k elements from n. The operations involved include exponentiation, multiplication, and summation. This theorem is fundamental in combinatorics, algebra, and probability theory, providing a direct formula for polynomial expansion without repeated multiplication. In the surrounding context, it is used to expand expressions like (x^2 + 3/x)^4, compute powers such as (98)^5 by rewriting as (100 - 2)^5, and analyze inequalities and divisibility properties involving powers, such as proving remainders modulo 25. The binomial theorem connects to combinatorial identities and modular arithmetic, illustrating its broad applicability. Practically, it simplifies calculations of large powers, aids in series expansions, and underpins many proofs in number theory and algebra. Within the broader framework, this equation serves as the foundational tool for the examples and exercises presented, demonstrating its central role in understanding polynomial expansions and their applications.",

Mathematically, it states that (1 + 5)^n can be expanded as the sum of terms of the form C(n, k) * 1^(n-k) * 5^k, where C(n, k) denotes the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\". Here, the variable n is a non-negative integer representing the power to which the binomial is raised. The binomial coefficients ^nC_k are defined combinatorially as n!/(k!(n-k)!). The powers of 5 increase from 0 to n, corresponding to each term in the expansion. The equation uses summation of products involving binomial coefficients and powers, illustrating the discrete combinatorial structure underlying polynomial expansions. In the surrounding context, this expansion is used to analyze expressions like 6^n by rewriting 6 as (1 + 5) and expanding to study divisibility properties modulo 25. This highlights the theoretical significance of the binomial theorem in number theory and modular arithmetic, particularly in proving congruences and remainder properties.

The triangle is composed of multiple rows, each row containing a sequence of integers. The topmost row starts with a single number '1'. Each subsequent row begins and ends with '1', and every interior number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it from the previous row. The numbers are centered and aligned to form a symmetrical triangle. The color scheme is monochromatic with black numbers on a white background, ensuring clear visibility and contrast. The lighting is uniform, with no shadows or highlights, emphasizing the clarity of the numerical pattern. The image is a clean, digital rendering without any additional decorative elements or text. This visual representation directly relates to the surrounding context discussing the binomial theorem, its historical development, and the coefficients in the expansion of (x + y)^n. Pascal's Triangle is a fundamental tool for understanding binomial coefficients, which are central to the exercises and historical notes on the page. The image serves as a visual aid to complement the mathematical explanations and historical references, illustrating the arrangement of coefficients that ancient and modern mathematicians studied. The technical detail lies in the precise numerical pattern and the triangular layout, which visually encodes the binomial coefficients for integral values of n.",

This series can also be expressed in abbreviated form using the sigma notation, i.e., \n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study about some special types of series which may be required in different problem situations. \n\nA.1.2 Binomial Theorem for any Index \n\nIn Chapter 8, we discussed the Binomial Theorem in which the index was a positive integer. In this Section, we state a more general form of the theorem in which the index is not necessarily a whole number. It gives us a particular type of infinite series, called Binomial Series. We illustrate few applications, by examples. \n\nWe know the formula \n\nHere, $n$ is non-negative integer. Observe that if we replace index $n$ by negative integer or a fraction, then the combinations ${}^n\\mathbf{C}_r$ do not make any sense. \n\nWe now state (without proof), the Binomial Theorem, giving an infinite series in which the index is negative or a fraction and not a whole number. \n\nTheorem The formula \n\nholds whenever $|x| < 1$ . \n\nRemark 1. Note carefully the condition $|x| < 1$ , i.e., $-1 < x < 1$ is necessary when $m$ is negative integer or a fraction. For example, if we take $x = -2$ and $m = -2$ , we obtain \n\nor $1 = 1 + 4 + 12 + \\dots .$ \n\nThis is not possible. \n\n2.

It expresses the expansion of the binomial expression (1 + x)^n as a finite sum of terms involving binomial coefficients and powers of x. Here, n is a non-negative integer indicating the power to which the binomial is raised, and x is a variable or real number. The binomial coefficients, denoted as ^nC_r (or \\binom{n}{r}), represent the number of combinations of n items taken r at a time and are defined as n!/(r!(n-r)!). The summation runs from r=0 to r=n, producing n+1 terms. The operations involved include exponentiation, multiplication, and addition. This theorem is foundational in combinatorics, algebra, and analysis, providing a direct formula for expanding powers of binomials without repeated multiplication. In the broader context of infinite series, this finite expansion is a special case when the exponent n is a non-negative integer. The chapter extends this concept to cases where the exponent is negative or fractional, leading to infinite series expansions known as binomial series, which converge under the condition |x|<1. The equation thus serves as a stepping stone from finite polynomial expansions to infinite series representations, highlighting the transition from discrete combinatorial coefficients to generalized binomial coefficients and infinite sums. Practical applications include probability theory, algebraic expansions, numerical methods, and series approximations in physics and engineering. It also underpins the study of power series and analytic functions in mathematical analysis.",

Mathematically, it states that (1 + x)^m can be expanded as the sum of terms involving powers of x multiplied by generalized binomial coefficients defined by the product m(m-1)(m-2)... divided by factorial denominators. Here, m is a real or complex number (not necessarily a non-negative integer), and x is a variable constrained by the convergence condition |x| < 1 to ensure the infinite series converges. The terms involve the Pochhammer symbol or falling factorial in the numerator and factorial in the denominator, representing generalized combinations. The operations include multiplication, exponentiation, and infinite summation. This theorem extends the classical binomial expansion from integer exponents to fractional and negative exponents, yielding an infinite series rather than a finite polynomial. It is fundamental in analysis, combinatorics, and applied mathematics, providing series expansions for functions like roots and reciprocals. The equation is crucial in contexts where expressions like (1 + x)^m need to be approximated or analyzed for non-integer m, such as in calculus, probability generating functions, and solving differential equations. It relates to infinite series theory, convergence criteria, and combinatorial identities. Practically, it is used in numerical methods, physics, and engineering to approximate functions and solve problems involving fractional powers. Within the broader discussion on infinite series and sequences, this equation exemplifies how infinite series can represent functions beyond polynomials, highlighting the importance of convergence conditions and generalizing classical results to wider domains.",

This expression is expanded as an infinite series using the generalized Binomial Theorem, which extends the classical Binomial Theorem to cases where the exponent is not a non-negative integer. Here, the exponent m = -2, and the base is (1 + x) with x = -2. The series is given by 1 + m x + (m(m-1)/2!) x^2 + ... , where each term involves binomial coefficients generalized for negative integers via the formula involving products of descending terms in the numerator and factorial in the denominator. The variables are: m = -2 (the exponent), x = -2 (the term added to 1 inside the parentheses), and the series terms involve powers of x and generalized binomial coefficients. The mathematical operations include exponentiation, multiplication, factorial, and infinite summation. The equation illustrates the necessity of the convergence condition |x| < 1 for the binomial series to be valid; here, since |x|=2 > 1, the series diverges, as shown by the example sum 1 + 4 + 12 + ... which does not converge to the finite value (1 - 2)^{-2} = 1. This highlights the theoretical significance of convergence criteria in infinite series expansions and the limitations of extending binomial expansions beyond their radius of convergence. The equation relates to the broader discussion on infinite series, binomial expansions for arbitrary exponents, and convergence conditions, emphasizing the importance of domain restrictions in infinite series representations. Practically, such expansions are used in mathematical analysis, physics, and engineering to approximate functions near certain points, but only within their radius of convergence. This example serves as a cautionary illustration within the framework of infinite series and generalized binomial expansions.",

The expansion is expressed as an infinite sum of terms involving powers of \\( \\frac{-x}{2} \\) multiplied by binomial coefficients generalized to fractional powers, specifically using the Pochhammer symbol or falling factorial for the numerator coefficients \\( \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right), \\ldots \\). The denominators are factorial terms \\( 1, 2, \\ldots \\) corresponding to the term index. The series begins with 1, followed by \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), then \\( \\frac{3x^2}{32} \\), and so forth, illustrating the pattern of coefficients. This expansion is a direct application of the binomial series for negative fractional exponents, which generalizes the classical binomial theorem beyond integer powers. The equation is significant in mathematical analysis and applied mathematics, particularly in approximations, series solutions to differential equations, and in physics for expansions of functions near a point. It also relates to the infinite geometric series concept discussed in the surrounding context, as the convergence criteria \\( |x| < 2 \\) parallels the condition \\( |r| < 1 \\) for geometric series convergence. Practically, such expansions are used in numerical methods, perturbation theory, and in deriving closed-form expressions for functions that are otherwise difficult to handle. Within the broader framework, this equation exemplifies the extension of binomial expansions to fractional and negative powers, highlighting the importance of convergence conditions and infinite series in advanced mathematical analysis.",

This equation is fundamental in the study of geometric progressions, illustrating how partial sums approach the sum to infinity as n increases, given |r| < 1. The physical or theoretical significance lies in modeling processes with exponential decay or growth constrained by a ratio less than one, such as population models, financial calculations, or signal attenuation. It relates directly to the infinite geometric series sum S = a/(1 - r) discussed in the context, showing the limiting behavior as n tends to infinity.

The column headers represent the exponent n, and the second row shows the computed values of the geometric sequence term (2/3)^n. Key data points include the rapid decrease of (2/3)^n as n increases: from 0.6667 at n=1 to 0.0003007 at n=20, illustrating the exponential decay characteristic of geometric progressions with common ratio less than 1. Statistically, the values decrease by roughly an order of magnitude every few increments in n, confirming the convergence of the infinite geometric series. The relationship between n and (2/3)^n is exponential decay, supporting the concept that as n approaches infinity, (2/3)^n approaches zero. This table concretely demonstrates the theoretical discussion in the surrounding content about the behavior of the term (2/3)^n in an infinite geometric series with first term a=1 and common ratio r=2/3.

Specifically, the terms are -5/4, 5/16, -5/64, ... which follow the pattern a, ar, ar^2, ... where each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by r. The negative sign in r causes the terms to alternate in sign, while the magnitude decreases geometrically since |r| < 1. This sequence converges to zero as n approaches infinity. The context discusses infinite geometric series and their sums, emphasizing that when |r| < 1, the infinite sum converges to S = a/(1 - r). Here, the series sum to infinity is calculated as -1, illustrating the application of the formula. This equation exemplifies the concept of convergence in infinite series, a fundamental topic in mathematical analysis and calculus. It also connects to the broader discussion on series expansions and convergence criteria, which are essential in fields such as numerical analysis, physics, and engineering for modeling and approximating functions.

    "content": "MATHEMATICAL MODELLING \n\nA.2.1 Introduction \n\nMuch of our progress in the last few centuries has made it necessary to apply mathematical methods to real-life problems arising from different fields – be it Science, Finance, Management etc. The use of Mathematics in solving real-world problems has become widespread especially due to the increasing computational power of digital computers and computing methods, both of which have facilitated the handling of lengthy and complicated problems. The process of translation of a real-life problem into a mathematical form can give a better representation and solution of certain problems. The process of translation is called Mathematical Modelling. \n\nHere we shall families you with the steps involved in this process through examples. We shall first talk about what a mathematical model is, then we discuss the steps involved in the process of modelling. \n\nA.2.2 Preliminaries \n\nMathematical modelling is an essential tool for understanding the world. In olden days the Chinese, Egyptians, Indians, Babylonians and Greeks indulged in understanding and predicting the natural phenomena through their knowledge of mathematics. The architects, artisans and craftsmen based many of their works of art on geometric principles. \n\nSuppose a surveyor wants to measure the height of a tower. It is physically very difficult to measure the height using the measuring tape. So, the other option is to find out the factors that are useful to find the height. From his knowledge of trigonometry, he knows that if he has an angle of elevation and the distance of the foot of the tower to the point where he is standing, then he can calculate the height of the tower. \n\nSo, his job is now simplified to find the angle of elevation to the top of the tower and the distance from the foot of the tower to the point where he is standing. Both of which are easily measurable. Thus, if he measures the angle of elevation as $40^{\\circ}$ and the distance as $450\\mathrm{m}$ , then the problem can be solved as given in Example 1. \n\nExample 1 The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point O on the ground, which is $450\\mathrm{m}$ away from the foot of the tower, is $40^{\\circ}$ . Find the height of the tower. \n\nSolution We shall solve this in different steps. \n\nStep 1 We first try to understand the real problem. In the problem a tower is given and its height is to be measured. Let $h$ denote the height. It is given that the horizontal distance of the foot of the tower from a particular point $O$ on the ground is $450 \\, \\text{m}$ . Let $d$ denotes this distance. Then $d = 450 \\, \\text{m}$ . We also know that the angle of elevation, denoted by $\\theta$ , is $40^\\circ$ . \n\nThe real problem is to find the height $h$ of the tower using the known distance $d$ and the angle of elevation $\\theta$ . \n\nStep 2 The three quantities mentioned in the problem are height, distance and angle of elevation. \n\nSo we look for a relation connecting these three quantities. This is obtained by expressing it geometrically in the following way (Fig 1). \n\nAB denotes the tower. OA gives the horizontal distance from the point O to foot of the tower. $\\angle AOB$ is the angle of elevation. Then we have \n\nThis is an equation connecting $\\theta, h$ and $d$ . \n\nLet us now look at the different steps used in solving the problem. In step 1, we have studied the real problem and found that the problem involves three parameters height, distance and angle of elevation. That means in this step we have studied the real-life problem and identified the parameters. \n\nIn the Step 2, we used some geometry and found that the problem can be represented geometr",

Then we used the trigonometric ratio for the \"tangent\" function and found the relation as \n\nSo, in this step we formulated the problem mathematically. That means we found an equation representing the real problem. \n\nIn Step 3, we solved the mathematical problem and got that $h = 377.6\\mathrm{m}$ . That is we found \n\nSolution of the problem. \n\nIn the last step, we interpreted the solution of the problem and stated that the height of the tower is approximately $378\\mathrm{m}$ . We call this as \n\nInterpreting the mathematical solution to the real situation \n\nIn fact these are the steps mathematicians and others use to study various real-life situations. We shall consider the question, \"why is it necessary to use mathematics to solve different situations.\" \n\nHere are some of the examples where mathematics is used effectively to study various situations. \n\nHow do mathematicians help in solving such problems? They sit with experts in the area, for example, a physiologist in the first problem and work out a mathematical equivalent of the problem. This equivalent consists of one or more equations or inequalities etc. which are called the mathematical models. Then \n\nsolve the model and interpret the solution in terms of the original problem. Before we explain the process, we shall discuss what a mathematical model is. \n\nA mathematical model is a representation which comprehends a situation. \n\nAn interesting geometric model is illustrated in the following example. \n\nExample 2 (Bridge Problem) Konigsberg is a town on the Pregel River, which in the \n\n18th century was a German town, but now is Russian. Within the town are two river islands that are connected to the banks with seven bridges as shown in (Fig 2). \n\nPeople tried to walk around the town in a way that only crossed each bridge once, but it proved to be difficult problem. Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician in the service of \n\nthe Russian empire Catherine the Great, heard about the problem. In 1736 Euler proved that the walk was not possible to do. He proved this by inventing a kind of diagram \n\ncalled a network, that is made up of vertices (dots where lines meet) and arcs (lines) (Fig3). \n\nHe used four dots (vertices) for the two river banks and the two islands. These have been marked A, B and C, D. The seven lines (arcs) are the seven bridges. You can see that 3 bridges (arcs) join to riverbank, A, and 3 join to riverbank B. 5 bridges (arcs) join to island C, and 3 join to island D. This means that all the vertices have an odd number of arcs, so they are called odd vertices (An even vertex \n\nwould have to have an even number of arcs joining to it). \n\nRemember that the problem was to travel around town crossing each bridge only once. On Euler's network this meant tracing over each arc only once, visiting all the vertices. Euler proved it could not be done because he worked out that, to have an odd vertex you would have to begin or end the trip at that vertex. (Think about it). Since there can only be one beginning and one end, there can only be two odd vertices if you are to trace over each arc only once. Since the bridge problem has 4 odd",

Since there can only be one beginning and one end, there can only be two odd vertices if you are to trace over each arc only once. Since the bridge problem has 4 odd vertices, it just not possible to do! \n\nAfter Euler proved his Theorem, much water has flown under the bridges in Konigsberg. In 1875, an extra bridge was built in Konigsberg, joining the land areas of river banks A and B (Fig 4).

After the addition of the new edge, both the vertices A and B have become even degree vertices. However, D and C still have odd degree. So, it \n\nIsland C \n\nis possible for the Konigsbergians to go around the city using each bridge exactly once. \n\nThe invention of networks began a new theory called graph theory which is now used in many ways, including planning and mapping railway networks (Fig 4). \n\nA.2.3 What is Mathematical Modelling? \n\nHere, we shall define what mathematical modelling is and illustrate the different processes involved in this through examples. \n\nDefinition Mathematical modelling is an attempt to study some part (or form) of the real-life problem in mathematical terms. \n\nConversion of physical situation into mathematics with some suitable conditions is known as mathematical modelling. Mathematical modelling is nothing but a technique and the pedagogy taken from fine arts and not from the basic sciences. Let us now understand the different processes involved in Mathematical Modelling. Four steps are involved in this process. As an illustrative example, we consider the modelling done to study the motion of a simple pendulum. \n\nUnderstanding the problem \n\nThis involves, for example, understanding the process involved in the motion of simple pendulum. All of us are familiar with the simple pendulum. This pendulum is simply a mass (known as bob) attached to one end of a string whose other end is fixed at a point. We have studied that the motion of the simple pendulum is periodic. The period depends upon the length of the string and acceleration due to gravity. So, what we need to find is the period of oscillation. Based on this, we give a precise statement of the problem as \n\nStatement How do we find the period of oscillation of the simple pendulum? \n\nThe next step is formulation. \n\nFormulation Consists of two main steps. \n\n1. Identifying the relevant factors In this, we find out what are the factors/ \n\nparameters involved in the problem. For example, in the case of pendulum, the factors are period of oscillation (T), the mass of the bob $(m)$ , effective length $(l)$ of the pendulum which is the distance between the point of suspension to the centre of mass of the bob. Here, we consider the length of string as effective length of the pendulum and acceleration due to gravity $(g)$ , which is assumed to be constant at a place. \n\nSo, we have identified four parameters for studying the problem. Now, our purpose is to find T. For this we need to understand what are the parameters that affect the period which can be done by performing a simple experiment. \n\nWe take two metal balls of two different masses and conduct experiment with each of them attached to two strings of equal lengths. We measure the period of oscillation. We make the observation that there is no appreciable change of the period with mass. Now, we perform the same experiment on equal mass of balls but take strings of different",

We measure the period of oscillation. We make the observation that there is no appreciable change of the period with mass. Now, we perform the same experiment on equal mass of balls but take strings of different lengths and observe that there is clear dependence of the period on the length of the pendulum. \n\nThis indicates that the mass $m$ is not an essential parameter for finding period whereas the length $l$ is an essential parameter. \n\nThis process of searching the essential parameters is necessary before we go to the next step. \n\n2. Mathematical description This involves finding an equation, inequality or a geometric figure using the parameters already identified. \n\nIn the case of simple pendulum, experiments were conducted in which the values of period $T$ were measured for different values of $l$ . These values were plotted on a graph which resulted in a curve that resembled a parabola. It implies that the relation between $T$ and $l$ could be expressed \n\nIt was found that $k = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g}$ . This gives the equation \n\nEquation (2) gives the mathematical formulation of the problem. \n\nFinding the solution The mathematical formulation rarely gives the answer directly. Usually we have to do some operation which involves solving an equation, calculation or applying a theorem etc. In the case of simple pendulums the solution involves applying the formula given in Equation (2). \n\nThe period of oscillation calculated for two different pendulums having different lengths is given in Table 1 \n\nThe table shows that for $l = 225 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ , $\\mathrm{T} = 3.04 \\, \\mathrm{sec}$ and for $l = 275 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ , $\\mathrm{T} = 3.36 \\, \\mathrm{sec}$ . \n\nInterpretation/Validation \n\nA mathematical model is an attempt to study, the essential characteristic of a real life problem. Many times model equations are obtained by assuming the situation in an idealised context. The model will be useful only if it explains all the facts that we would like it to explain. Otherwise, we will reject it, or else, improve it, then test it again. In other words, we measure the effectiveness of the model by comparing the results obtained from the mathematical model, with the known facts about the real problem. This process is called validation of the model. In the case of simple pendulum, we conduct some experiments on the pendulum and find out period of oscillation. The results of the experiment are given in Table 2. \n\nNow, we compare the measured values in Table 2 with the calculated values given in Table 1. \n\nThe difference in the observed values and calculated values gives the error. For example, for $l = 275 \\, \\text{cm}$ , and mass $m = 385 \\, \\text{gm}$ , \n\nwhich is small and the model is accepted. \n\nOnce we accept the model, we have to interpret the model. The process of describing the solution in the context of the real situation is called interpretation of the model. In this case, we can interpret the solution in the following way: \n\n(a) The period is directly proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum. \n\n(b) It is inversely proportional to the square root of the acceleration due to gravity. \n\nOur validation and interpretation of this model shows that the mathematical model is in good agreement with the practical (or observed) values. But we found that there is some error in the calculated result and measured result. This is because we have neglected",

But we found that there is some error in the calculated result and measured result. This is because we have neglected the mass of the string and resistance of the medium. So, in such situation we look for a better model and this process continues. \n\nThis leads us to an important observation. The real world is far too complex to understand and describe completely. We just pick one or two main factors to be completely accurate that may influence the situation. Then try to obtain a simplified model which gives some information about the situation. We study the simple situation with this model expecting that we can obtain a better model of the situation. Now, we summarise the main process involved in the modelling as \n\n(a) Formulation \n\n(b) Solution \n\n(c) Interpretation/Validation \n\nThe next example shows how modelling can be done using the techniques of finding graphical solution of inequality. \n\nExample 3 A farm house uses at least $800\\mathrm{kg}$ of special food daily. The special food is a mixture of corn and soyabean with the following compositions \n\nThe dietary requirements of the special food stipulate at least $30\\%$ protein and at most $5\\%$ fibre. Determine the daily minimum cost of the food mix. \n\nSolution Step 1 Here the objective is to minimise the total daily cost of the food which is made up of corn and soyabean. So the variables (factors) that are to be considered are \n\nStep 2 The last column in Table 3 indicates that $z, x, y$ are related by the equation \n\nThe problem is to minimise $z$ with the following constraints: \n\n(a) The farm used atleast $800\\mathrm{kg}$ food consisting of corn and soyabean \n\n(b) The food should have at least $30\\%$ protein dietary requirement in the proportion as given in the first column of Table 3. This gives \n\n(c) Similarly the food should have atmost $5\\%$ fibre in the proportion given in 2nd column of Table 3. This gives \n\nWe simplify the constraints given in (2), (3) and (4) by grouping all the coefficients of $x, y$ . \n\nThen the problem can be restated in the following mathematical form. Statement Minimise $z$ subject to \n\nThis gives the formulation of the model. \n\nStep 3 This can be solved graphically. The shaded region in Fig 5 gives the possible solution of the equations. From the graph it is clear that the minimum value is got at the point (470.6,329.4) i.e., $x = 470.6$ and $y = 329.4$ . \n\nThis gives the value of $z$ as $z = 10 \\times 470.6 + 20 \\times 329.4 = 11294$ \n\nThis is the mathematical solution. \n\nStep 4 The solution can be interpreted as saying that, \"The minimum cost of the special food with corn and soyabean having the required portion of nutrient contents, protein and fibre is Rs 11294 and we obtain this minimum cost if we use $470.6\\mathrm{kg}$ of corn and $329.4\\mathrm{kg}$ of soyabean.\" \n\nIn the next example, we shall discuss how modelling is used to study the population of a country at a particular time. \n\nExample 4 Suppose a population control unit wants to find out \"how many people will be there in a certain country after 10 years\"",

Let $t$ denote the time in years. Then $t$ takes values 0, 1, 2, ..., $t = 0$ stands for the present time, $t = 1$ stands for the next year etc. For any time $t$ , let $p(t)$ denote the population in that particular year. \n\nSuppose we want to find the population in a particular year, say $t_0 = 2006$ . How will we do that. We find the population by Jan. 1st, 2005. Add the number of births in that year and subtract the number of deaths in that year. Let $\\mathrm{B}(t)$ denote the number of births in the one year between $t$ and $t + 1$ and $\\mathrm{D}(t)$ denote the number of deaths between $t$ and $t + 1$ . Then we get the relation \n\nNow we make some assumptions and definitions \n\nAssumptions \n\n1. The birth rate is the same for all intervals. Likewise, the death rate is the same for all intervals. This means that there is a constant $b$ , called the birth rate, and a constant $d$ , called the death rate so that, for all $t \\geq 0$ , \n\n2. There is no migration into or out of the population; i.e., the only source of population change is birth and death. \n\nAs a result of assumptions 1 and 2, we deduce that, for $t \\geq 0$ , \n\nSetting $t = 0$ in (2) gives \n\nSetting $t = 1$ in Equation (2) gives \n\nContinuing this way, we get \n\nfor $t = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ . The constant $1 + b - d$ is often abbreviated by $r$ and called the growth rate or, in more high-flown language, the Malthusian parameter, in honor of Robert Malthus who first brought this model to popular attention. In terms of $r$ , Equation (4) becomes \n\n$\\mathrm{P}(t)$ is an example of an exponential function. Any function of the form $cr^t$ , where $c$ and $r$ are constants, is an exponential function. \n\nEquation (5) gives the mathematical formulation of the problem. \n\nStep 2 - Solution \n\nSuppose the current population is 250,000,000 and the rates are $b = 0.02$ and $d = 0.01$ . What will the population be in 10 years? Using the formula, we calculate $\\mathrm{P}(10)$ . \n\nStep 3 Interpretation and Validation \n\nNaturally, this result is absurd, since one can't have 0.25 of a person. \n\nSo, we do some approximation and conclude that the population is 276,155,531 (approximately). Here, we are not getting the exact answer because of the assumptions that we have made in our mathematical model. \n\nThe above examples show how modelling is done in a variety of situations using different mathematical techniques. \n\nSince a mathematical model is a",

The angle at point O, labeled as 'θ = 40°', is the angle of elevation from point O to the top of the tower B. The right angle is at point A, indicating that AB is perpendicular to AO. The diagram uses simple black lines on a white background, with clear labels for points, distances, and angles. The layout is clean and uncluttered, focusing on the triangle to visually represent the mathematical model described in the surrounding text. This visual element directly supports the explanation of how the height of the tower can be calculated using the tangent trigonometric function, connecting the angle of elevation and the horizontal distance to the height.

    "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\nh = d \\tan \\theta\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: The equation h = d \\tan \\theta represents a fundamental trigonometric relationship used to determine the height of a vertical object (such as a tower) based on the angle of elevation and the horizontal distance from the observer to the base of the object. Here, h denotes the height of the tower, d is the horizontal distance from the observation point to the foot of the tower, and \\theta is the angle of elevation measured from the horizontal line of sight to the top of the tower. The tangent function, \\tan, is a trigonometric ratio defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. This equation arises from the geometric interpretation of the problem, where the tower, the ground, and the line of sight form a right triangle. The equation is derived from the definition \\tan \\theta = \\frac{h}{d}, rearranged to solve for h. This mathematical model exemplifies the process of translating a real-world measurement problem into a solvable mathematical form, illustrating the application of trigonometry in practical surveying and measurement tasks. It highlights the importance of mathematical modeling in simplifying complex physical measurements by using measurable parameters and known mathematical functions. The equation is foundational in fields such as surveying, architecture, engineering, and physics, where indirect measurement techniques are essential. It also connects to broader mathematical concepts such as right triangle trigonometry, angle measurement, and function application in modeling physical phenomena. Within the broader discussion, this equation serves as a primary example of how mathematical modeling bridges real-life problems and mathematical solutions, demonstrating the stepwise approach from problem identification, parameter definition, mathematical formulation, solution, and interpretation.",

The diagram consists of four vertices represented by labeled black dots: A, B, C, and D. Vertices A and B represent the two riverbanks, while C and D represent the two islands in the Pregel River. Seven edges (lines) connect these vertices, symbolizing the seven bridges. The new bridge is depicted as an additional edge directly linking vertices A and B, which were previously unconnected. The edges are simple black lines connecting the vertices, with no arrows, indicating undirected connections. The layout is roughly rectangular, with vertices A and B positioned on opposite sides, and vertices C and D placed between them, representing the islands. The visual style is schematic and minimalistic, focusing on clarity and the relationships between vertices and edges rather than realistic geographic detail. The image uses a white background with black lines and dots for high contrast and easy readability. This network diagram visually supports the textual explanation that after adding the new bridge, vertices A and B have even degrees, while C and D remain odd, making it possible to traverse each bridge exactly once. The image is a direct visual aid to the surrounding content discussing Euler's solution to the Konigsberg bridge problem and the implications of adding a new bridge on the possibility of an Eulerian path.",

Here, \\( \\mathrm{T} \\) denotes the period of oscillation, which is the time taken for one complete cycle of the pendulum's swing, and \\( l \\) is the effective length of the pendulum, measured from the point of suspension to the center of mass of the bob. The constant \\( k \\) encapsulates physical constants and parameters, specifically \\( k = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\), where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, assumed constant at the location of the experiment. Mathematically, this equation expresses that the square of the period is directly proportional to the length of the pendulum, indicating a quadratic dependence of \\( \\mathrm{T} \\) on \\( l \\). The operations involved include squaring the period and multiplication by a constant factor. This equation emerges from empirical observations and theoretical derivations under idealized assumptions such as small angular displacements and negligible air resistance. It is a cornerstone in classical mechanics and oscillatory motion, linking time-periodic behavior to geometric and gravitational parameters. The equation relates to other concepts in the context, such as the identification of essential parameters in mathematical modeling and the validation of models through experimental data. Practically, it is used in designing pendulum clocks, measuring gravitational acceleration, and understanding harmonic motion. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the process of mathematical modeling: starting from a physical problem, identifying relevant variables, formulating a mathematical relationship, and validating it against experimental results, thereby illustrating the power of mathematical abstraction in solving real-world problems.",

The variable l denotes the effective length of the pendulum, measured from the point of suspension to the center of mass of the bob, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, assumed constant at the location. Mathematically, this formula arises from solving the differential equation governing simple harmonic motion under the small-angle approximation, where the restoring force is proportional to displacement. The equation involves the constant 2\\pi, reflecting the periodic nature of oscillations, and the square root function indicating that the period scales with the square root of the length divided by gravitational acceleration. This relationship shows that the period is independent of the mass of the bob, a fact confirmed experimentally. The formula is fundamental in classical mechanics and mathematical modeling, illustrating how physical phenomena can be described by mathematical expressions. It connects to broader concepts such as harmonic oscillators, differential equations, and experimental validation of models. Practically, it is used in timekeeping, pendulum clocks, and educational demonstrations of periodic motion. Within the context, this equation exemplifies the process of mathematical modeling: identifying relevant parameters, formulating a mathematical description, and validating the model through experiments, thereby bridging theoretical physics and real-world observations.",

The first row lists the lengths of the pendulum string in centimeters: 225 cm and 275 cm. The second row provides the corresponding measured periods of oscillation in seconds: 3.04 sec for 225 cm and 3.36 sec for 275 cm. This data supports the experimental observation that the period T depends on the length l of the pendulum. The increase in length from 225 cm to 275 cm results in an increase in period from 3.04 sec to 3.36 sec, illustrating the direct proportionality between T and the square root of l as described in the surrounding context. The table validates the mathematical model T = 2π√(l/g) by showing measured values that align closely with calculated values, confirming that mass does not affect the period while length does. This concise data presentation aids in the interpretation and validation phase of the modeling process, demonstrating the practical application of theoretical formulas to real-world measurements and highlighting minor discrepancies due to neglected factors like string mass and air resistance.",

The 'Mass' column groups two rows each, showing two different masses (385 gms and 230 gms) tested with two string lengths (275 cms and 225 cms) each. The 'Length' column specifies the effective length of the pendulum string, and the 'Time' column records the measured period of oscillation in seconds. Key data points include periods for length 275 cms being approximately 3.371 sec and 3.352 sec for masses 385 gms and 230 gms respectively, and for length 225 cms being 3.056 sec and 3.042 sec respectively. Patterns reveal that the period T increases with length l, consistent with the theoretical model, while changes in mass m show negligible effect on T, supporting the conclusion that mass is not an essential parameter for period determination. Statistical insight shows minimal variation in period for different masses at the same length (difference less than 0.02 sec), indicating mass independence. The relationship between length and period is positive and aligns with the square root proportionality described in the surrounding context. This table validates the mathematical model by comparing observed periods with calculated values, demonstrating small errors and confirming the model's applicability. It supports the concept that the period depends primarily on length and gravity, not mass, and illustrates the experimental step in model validation and interpretation discussed in the text.",

Here, 'error' quantifies the deviation between the measured value (3.371 seconds) and the predicted value (3.36 seconds) of the period T. This subtraction operation is a basic arithmetic calculation used to assess the accuracy of the mathematical model derived earlier, specifically the formula T = 2π√(l/g). The variables involved are the period T, measured in seconds, and the error, a dimensionless quantity indicating the discrepancy. The context is the validation phase of the pendulum model, where experimental data is compared against theoretical predictions to evaluate model fidelity. The small error value (0.011 seconds) suggests that the simplified model, which neglects factors like air resistance and string mass, is a good approximation for the physical system. This error analysis is crucial in mathematical modeling as it informs the model's reliability and guides potential refinements. It also exemplifies the broader framework of model formulation, solution, and interpretation/validation discussed in the surrounding content.

Soyabean contains significantly higher protein at 0.60 kg and fibre at 0.06 kg per kg, costing Rs 20 per kg. The data reveals that soyabean is more nutrient-dense but also more expensive. This table supports the surrounding content by providing the essential nutritional and cost parameters needed to formulate a cost-minimization model for a special food mix that meets dietary constraints of at least 30% protein and at most 5% fibre.

The shaded region is clearly marked with a light gray fill. A specific point within this feasible region is highlighted and labeled with coordinates approximately (470.6, 329.4), indicating the optimal solution where the minimum cost is achieved. The graph includes grid lines for better readability and precise interpretation of values. The visual style is clean and technical, using black lines on a white background with gray shading for the feasible region. The image directly relates to the surrounding text, which discusses the formulation, solution, and interpretation of a linear programming model to minimize the cost of a food mixture while meeting nutritional constraints.

It is structured as a numbered list with two items, each defining a rate as a ratio involving population and event counts over a time interval. Specifically, the first item defines the birth rate as the ratio of births to population during the interval from time t to t+1, and the second item defines the death rate similarly as the ratio of deaths to population over the same interval. These definitions are fundamental components in the mathematical formulation of population change models presented in the surrounding context. The list directly supports the assumptions and equations that follow, providing precise terminology and quantitative measures essential for modeling population growth or decline. This content connects to the broader discussion by establishing the parameters (birth rate and death rate) used in the exponential growth model and the Malthusian parameter r, facilitating understanding of how population evolves over discrete time intervals.

Mathematically, b = B(t)/P(t) and d = D(t)/P(t), where B(t) is the number of births between time t and t+1, D(t) is the number of deaths in the same interval, and P(t) is the population at time t. These ratios represent per capita rates, quantifying the fraction of the population that is born or dies in one time unit. The equation uses division, a fundamental arithmetic operation, to normalize absolute counts by population size, enabling comparison across different population scales. This formulation is central to demographic modeling and population dynamics, providing a basis for discrete-time population growth models. It relates directly to the Malthusian growth parameter r = 1 + b - d, which governs exponential population change. The equation's theoretical significance lies in its role in simplifying complex population changes into manageable parameters under assumptions of constant birth and death rates and no migration. Practically, it allows prediction of future population sizes and informs policy decisions in population control and resource planning.

The parameter \\( r = 1 + b - d \\) is the net growth rate or Malthusian parameter, where \\( b \\) is the constant birth rate and \\( d \\) is the constant death rate, both assumed uniform over time intervals. The equation models population change solely due to births and deaths, excluding migration, under the assumptions of constant rates and discrete yearly intervals. Mathematically, it is an exponential function characterized by repeated multiplication of the initial population by the growth factor \\( r \\) raised to the power \\( t \\). This model is foundational in demography and ecology for predicting population size over time, illustrating how populations grow or decline exponentially when growth rates are constant. It relates to other concepts such as difference equations and geometric progressions. Practically, it aids in forecasting population sizes for planning and resource allocation. Within the broader discussion, this equation exemplifies the use of mathematical modeling to simplify and analyze real-world phenomena, highlighting the importance of assumptions and approximations in model validity and interpretation.",

Mathematically, it is expressed as P(10) = (1.01)^10 × 250,000,000, where P(t) denotes the population at year t, 250,000,000 is the initial population at t = 0, and 1.01 is the growth factor derived from the net growth rate r = 1 + b - d, with b = 0.02 (birth rate) and d = 0.01 (death rate). The operation involves exponentiation of the growth factor to the power of 10, reflecting compounding growth over 10 years, followed by multiplication with the initial population. This model assumes constant birth and death rates and no migration, leading to a discrete-time geometric progression. The equation exemplifies the Malthusian growth model, a fundamental concept in population dynamics and mathematical biology, illustrating how populations evolve under simple assumptions. It relates to exponential functions and discrete dynamical systems, providing a theoretical framework for predicting future population sizes. Practically, it aids policymakers and demographers in forecasting population trends, resource planning, and understanding demographic changes. Within the broader discussion, this equation demonstrates the application of mathematical modeling to real-world problems, highlighting the importance of assumptions, approximations, and model validation in deriving meaningful and interpretable results.",

This concept is foundational in discrete mathematics, computer science, and logic, where relations and functions are modeled as subsets of Cartesian products. The equation relates to other concepts such as domain, range, and relations discussed in the context, providing a concrete example of how sets combine to form pairs. Practically, Cartesian products are used in database theory (cross joins), combinatorics, and defining coordinate systems. Overall, this equation exemplifies the transition from simple sets to structured pairs, enabling the study of relations and functions within the broader mathematical framework presented.",

The first equation, (f - g)(x) = -x + 4, expresses the pointwise difference of f and g as a linear function in x. The second equation, (f/g)(x) = (x + 1)/(2x - 3), defines the quotient of f and g as a rational function with a domain restriction x ≠ 3/2 to avoid division by zero. Variables involved include x, the independent variable typically representing a real number, and functions f and g, which are implicitly defined through these operations. The operations used are subtraction and division of functions, evaluated pointwise. This setup is common in real analysis and algebra, particularly in studying function operations and their properties such as domain, range, and continuity. The equations illustrate how combining functions through arithmetic operations yields new functions with distinct algebraic forms and domain considerations. The physical or theoretical significance lies in understanding function behavior under combination, which is foundational in calculus, functional analysis, and applied mathematics. These expressions relate to broader discussions on function operations, domain restrictions, and the construction of new functions from existing ones. Practical applications include modeling scenarios where combined effects are represented by function differences or ratios, such as in physics for net forces or rates, or in economics for cost-benefit analyses. Within the broader framework of the surrounding exercises, which focus on relations, domains, and ranges, these equations exemplify function operations and domain considerations, reinforcing the conceptual understanding of function manipulation and their algebraic properties.",

The list items are enumerated with Roman numerals (iv) through (viii), each presenting a mathematical relation or explicit set notation involving ordered pairs. The expressions include empty intersections (A ∩ B = ∅), set differences (A - C), unions (B ∪ C), intersections (B ∩ C), and a triple intersection involving complements (A ∩ B' ∩ C'). These components are interrelated, describing relationships between the sets in terms of their elements, which are ordered pairs likely representing outcomes in a probability or combinatorial context. The list supports the broader discussion on set operations and event relationships in probability theory, as indicated by the surrounding exercises on chapters 13 and 14. This content is significant for knowledge retrieval as it provides explicit examples of set operations applied to event sets, useful for understanding mutual exclusivity, event unions, and intersections in probability exercises.
