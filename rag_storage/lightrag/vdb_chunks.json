HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-4f982ead5b22d4a4119be2007691d33b", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5ce150dfbedcd5942dacdc313367fc65", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "= 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally, $x^2 - 9 = 0$ implies $x = 3, -3$ and so (iv) matches (b). \n\nEXERCISE 1.1 \n\n1. Which of the following are sets? Justify your answer. \n\n2. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ .

Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1,", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-ecae2583983d01b05d2a560a5cb7ed4c", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": ", we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of integers. All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ .

From the sets given below, select equal sets : \n\n1.6 Subsets \n\nConsider the sets: $X =$ set of all students in your school, $Y =$ set of all students in your class. \n\nWe note that every element of $\\mathrm{Y}$ is also an element of $\\mathrm{X}$ ; we say that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ . The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies. Using this symbol, we can write the definition of subset as follows: \n\nWe read the above statement as \"A is a subset of $B$ if a is an element of $A$ implies that a is also an element of $B$ \". If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A. In this case, A and B are the same sets so that we have A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A ⇌ A", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-280776969a2dfbadb74f2b7a2c44f63a", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A. In this case, A and B are the same sets so that we have A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A ⇌ A = B, where “ $\\Leftrightarrow$ ” is a symbol for two way implications, and is usually read as if and only if (briefly written as “iff”). \n\nIt follows from the above definition that every set $A$ is a subset of itself, i.e., $A \\subset A$ . Since the empty set $\\phi$ has no elements, we agree to say that $\\phi$ is a subset of every set. We now consider some examples: \n\nLet A and B be two sets. If $\\mathrm{A}\\subset \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{A}\\neq \\mathrm{B}$ , then A is called a proper subset of B and B is called superset of A. For example, \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ is a proper subset of $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ . \n\nIf a set $A$ has only one element, we call it a singleton set.

Is $\\mathrm{A}$ a subset of $\\mathrm{B}$ ? No. (Why?). Is $\\mathrm{B}$ a subset of $\\mathrm{A}$ ? No. (Why?) \n\nExample 11 Let A, B and C be three sets. If A $\\in$ B and B $\\subset$ C, is it true that A $\\subset$ C?. If not, give an example. \n\nSolution No. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{\\{1\\}, 2\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{\\{1\\}, 2, 3\\}$ .

Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational.

Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "eJwFwX1sDFkAAHAf19AIlbCoIkhZujbt7s7MvvfmzW6XtqgiUkq6IWmauKTORxGcj7ujkYqU1KaoiDalim5tZ3dndt7MvDezlRSRUIfENbijzkd93h/uEB+5368ZrobNQi5bZxh0kFNBN74I3Z07zaLQSGe+54C8BK2Sa+x93CIjbrwTm8h5coj9RSOkxtGreekaSYMd0jDbpCX2R7cufvb/oz5Fb5BMusCMeLmnLy+Dyb5ngZi3LrfBaFPG4KMpr17t3xDCWr+4Fh0EWXoIacbpzpl2AraZi0FlfChsTo5jQAgDPvkKXvAMJyQOC56QPFrRvdS3wZozNwdc17PhOZOyrXiEaqOUMdlb1X5fauTnkd9IF8/RLL0eN4DbmIv+7utnCJECOZWiK8HPagkWZJF/RHPsUfNd8n1B7+nBdcovnJ8bb0ZIRqDEGJCGmDzLpk7L6ZeMKF5xahbJD6zhR9Oy4Av/fuQQ7ymZdi116Ncu2lJe4Lk1IbiPe61MZCfV3bAytRm/CCxQR6oRPo4bqMJ9hbXejXxSccLtplO+TS/oRM/qjmr1BnC3d2TKMT5T+QD+QMvRkfNFsSyxPXAG97HJMNLVyEpTpa4f0J15vfaAUEAH8Fs8SJJqjC/Mf+DfSKao36wmr4D7g9XGj0KxdQ70guPRVvAaLZZe8evZQk/4sgoep6cm5KSCj+KxVCw8KW2iNvikfHHtUBPJEG331FizlUuqpnzAt3KvxtcFi/GV6Hdcyh6p5WyQfCXb6E14AN7Fbs84+j7WpO+xW6Q+Wudaj8NKFavk6/V+PiLu4Rrx38ABinEZLcfZ6kOwRa/0ydIyP3T9K7ayh3xYiFh/JnSxyppOKoQT2OEfAr+ZYdKCz6An+KX+kc7w7rx8NjUXDS2cBo+ld2sDIO1ZGbjWephNAxO0XbQpMSrdgWXNg8rw4dx7YK+YQ2sntgTL0hVcgENGPmoLTtLy3D36LdOFU+o2ttf5K+2UtqSd6k+hHLbc0mAv/k+LgaLkETHDdwNUi/8DRLNrVA=="}, {"__id__": "chunk-df7c27dd62a4e99389d4371e68e649f9", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in set-builder form, can be written in the form of interval as $(-5, 7]$ and the interval $[-3, 5)$ can be written in set-builder form as $\\{x : -3 \\leq x < 5\\}$ . \n\nThe number $(b - a)$ is called the length of any of the intervals $(a, b)$ , $[a, b]$ , $[a, b)$ or $(a, b]$ . \n\n1.7 Universal Set \n\nUsually, in a particular context, we have to deal with the elements and subsets of a basic set which is relevant to that particular context. For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1.

Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-50de78039a2ca065dc9e38e2f05d73e8", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets.

This is the set of students from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both. \n\nThus, we can define the union of two sets as follows: \n\nDefinition 5 The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those \n\nelements which are either in A or in B (including those which are in both).

The symbol \\(\\cap\\) is used to denote the intersection. The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically, we write A \\(\\cap\\) B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}\\). \n\nExample 15 Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find A $\\cap$ B. \n\nSolution We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both A and B. Hence $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{6, 8\\}$ . \n\nExample 16 Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X $\\cap$ Y. \n\nSolution We see that element 'Geeta' is the only element common to both. Hence, $\\mathrm{X} \\cap \\mathrm{Y} = \\{\\mathrm{Geeta}\\}$ . \n\nExample 17 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ and hence show that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSolution We have $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\} = \\mathrm{B}$ . We note that $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ and that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nDefinition 6 The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $x\\in \\mathrm{B}\\}$ \n\nThe shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the intersection of A and B. \n\nIf A and B are two sets such that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ , then A and B are called disjoint sets. \n\nFor example, let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1,3,5,7\\}$ . Then A and B are disjoint sets, because there are no elements which are common to A and B. The disjoint sets can be represented by means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6 In the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets. \n\nSome Properties of Operation of Intersection \n\n(v) $\\mathrm{A}\\cap (\\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{C}) = (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B})\\cup (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{C})$ (Distributive law) i.e., $\\cap$", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1e1f221359a371dfa26c8523342f2c03", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "The disjoint sets can be represented by means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6 In the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets. \n\nSome Properties of Operation of Intersection \n\n(v) $\\mathrm{A}\\cap (\\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{C}) = (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B})\\cup (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{C})$ (Distributive law) i.e., $\\cap$ distributes over $\\cup$ \n\nThis can be seen easily from the following Venn diagrams [Figs 1.7 (i) to (v)]. \n\n1.9.3 Difference of sets The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not to B.

Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-3e7129fde25450304f236efeac7a44cc", "__created_at__": 1770825665, "content": "}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\not\\in\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\}$ \n\nIt is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal \n\nset U, we have $\\left(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nNow, we want to find the results for $(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})'$ and $\\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ in the following example. \n\nExample 22 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ , $\\mathrm{A} = \\{2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$ . \n\nFind $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B}$ and hence show that $(\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B})^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime}$ \n\nSolution Clearly $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 4, 5, 6\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 2, 6\\}$ . Hence $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 6\\}$ . \n\nAlso $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\{2,3,4,5\\}$ , so that $(\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\{1,6\\}$ \n\nIt can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ .

These are called De Morgan's laws.

These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-1a4495550cb05e8d7f7bf050d41faf4a", "__created_at__": 1770826999, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/Maths_XI/output/kemh101/hybrid_auto/images/eb471ba1a2783294c952c1a7f910b2d633621ac05d066fa20f0b0cf8459f0c02.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: {\n    \"detailed_description\": {\n        \"composition_and_layout\": \"The image is a portrait of Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, with a serious expression.

This is denoted by the symbol ⊂. The equation states that for any element a in A, it implies that a is also in B. This definition is crucial in understanding the relationships between sets and their elements.\n\n    In this context, the variables A and B represent sets, while a represents an arbitrary element of set A. The implication operator (⇒) indicates that if a is an element of A, then it must also be an element of B for A to be considered a subset of B.\n\n    This equation has significant implications in various mathematical disciplines, including set theory, algebra, and topology. It provides the foundation for understanding concepts such as proper subsets, supersets, and equal sets.\n\n    The relationship between this equation and other mathematical concepts is evident in the context of subset relationships. For instance, if A ⊂ B and A ≠ B, then A is a proper subset of B, and B is a superset of A.\n\n    In practical applications, understanding subset relationships is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data analysis, and engineering. It enables the identification of patterns, relationships, and structures within complex datasets and systems.\n\n    The equation's significance extends beyond mathematical theory to real-world problems. For example, in database design, understanding subset relationships helps in optimizing data storage and retrieval processes. In machine learning, it aids in identifying relevant features and relationships between variables.\n\n    Overall, the given equation is a fundamental concept in set theory that has far-reaching implications in various mathematical disciplines and practical applications.", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-86a448656762bca7890b9e533b302000", "__created_at__": 1770826999, "content": "Header Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'header', 'text': 'SETS ', 'bbox': [805, 103, 848, 116], 'page_idx': 8}\n\nAnalysis: The header content is related to sets, specifically subsets, as indicated by the surrounding text discussing subset relationships and definitions.

This equation can be interpreted as follows: if we take the complement of a set A and the complement of another set B, and then find their intersection, it will result in the same set as taking the union of A and B and finding its complement.

The diagram consists of three overlapping circles representing the sets A, B, and X. Set A intersects with set X at point A ∩ X = φ, while set B also intersects with set X at point B ∩ X = φ. However, when considering the union of sets A and X (A ∪ X) and the union of sets B and X (B ∪ X), it is shown that these unions are equal. The diagram illustrates this equality by overlapping the circles representing sets A and B with set X. This visual representation supports the mathematical proof provided in the surrounding text, which aims to show that if A ∩ X = B ∩ X = φ and A ∪ X = B ∪ X for some set X, then A = B.\n\nThe diagram is drawn in a simple yet clear style, with each circle labeled accordingly. The colors used are standard mathematical notation colors, with black representing the sets and white representing the background. The lighting is neutral, providing no distractions from the visual representation of the sets.\n\nIn terms of technical details, the diagram appears to be hand-drawn or created using a simple drawing tool", "full_doc_id": "doc-ee0f04997f857db3ad3b2e00e1309f7d", "file_path": "kemh101.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-120232d9176afea738d10545c38bf572", "__created_at__": 1770826999, "content": "Header Content Analysis:\nContent: {'type': 'header', 'text': 'SETS ', 'bbox': [797, 103, 841, 116], 'page_idx': 22}\n\nAnalysis: The header content is a concise summary of the chapter's focus on set theory, referencing Georg Cantor as its originator.

In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The \n\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. \n\n2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets \n\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e., \n\nwhere $b, c$ and $s$ represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively. \n\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets? \n\nProceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below: \n\n(red, $b$ ), (red, $c$ ), (red, $s$ ), (blue, $b$ ), (blue, $c$ ), (blue, $s$ ). \n\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). \n\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ is a pair of elements written in small \n\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., $(p,q), p \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $q \\in \\mathrm{Q}$ . This leads to the following definition: \n\nDefinition 1 Given two non-empty sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . The cartesian product $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ , i.e., \n\nIf either $\\mathrm{P}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the null set, then $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ will also be empty set, i.e., $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\phi$ \n\nFrom the illustration given above we note that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(\\mathrm{red},b),(\\mathrm{red},c),(\\mathrm{red},s),(\\mathrm{blue},b),(\\mathrm{blue},c),(\\mathrm{blue},s)\\} .$ \n\nAgain, consider the two sets: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{\\mathrm{DL}, \\mathrm{MP}, \\mathrm{KA}\\}$ , where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{01,02,03\\}$ representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e80862d06b97a302ca78d59d84c5958", "file_path": "kemh102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-f2d86234c9e12c0663601d9bed6214b9", "__created_at__": 1770833364, "content": "by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03), (KA,01), (KA,02), (KA,03) and the product of set A and set B is given by \n\nIt can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since there are 3 elements in each of the sets A and B. This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL). \n\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and \n\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position $(a_{1}, b_{2})$ will be distinct from the point in the position $(b_{2}, a_{1})$ . \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal. \n\nExample 1 If $(x + 1, y - 2) = (3, 1)$ , find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal. \n\nTherefore $x + 1 = 3$ and $y - 2 = 1$ \n\nSolving we get $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ . \n\nExample 2 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{r\\}$ , form the sets $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nAre these two products equal? \n\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product, \n\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair $(a, r)$ is not equal to the pair $(r, a)$ , we conclude that $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} \\neq \\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nHowever, the number of elements in each set will be the same. \n\nExample 3 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3,4\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{4,5,6\\}$ .

It is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as 'map' or 'mapping' used to denote a function. \n\nDefinition 5 A relation $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if every element of set $A$ has one and only one image in set $B$ . \n\nIn other words, a function $f$ is a relation from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ such that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and no two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element. \n\nIf $f$ is a function from A to B and $(a, b) \\in f$ , then $f(a) = b$ , where $b$ is called the image of $a$ under $f$ and $a$ is called the preimage of $b$ under $f$ . \n\nThe function $f$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ is denoted by $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image. \n\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and the relation $\\mathbf{R}$ be defined on $\\mathbf{N}$ such that $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}\\}$ . \n\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function? \n\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N. The range is the set of even natural numbers. \n\nSince every natural number $n$ has one and only one image, this relation is a function. \n\nExample 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not? \n\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function. \n\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a real function. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers. Define a real valued function \n\n$f\\colon \\mathbf{N}\\to \\mathbf{N}$ by $f(x) = 2x + 1$ .

He considered a function in terms of \"mathematical job\" – the \"employee\" being just a curve. \n\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval. \n\nFunction is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: \"The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities\".", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e80862d06b97a302ca78d59d84c5958", "file_path": "kemh102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-37e493e0d52af0caf35b41311c604eff", "__created_at__": 1770834658, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/Maths_XI/output/kemh102/hybrid_auto/images/37ac2602634542119f407a8c48c898814a85ef86b7b0f751294e60fcaa580708.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: {\n    \"detailed_description\": {\n        \"composition_and_layout\": \"The image is a portrait of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), a German philosopher and mathematician, with a simple background.\",\n        \"objects\": [\n            {\"name\": \"Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\", \"description\": \"A portrait of the German philosopher and mathematician\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Background\", \"description\": \"Simple background without any notable features\"}\n        ],\n        \"text\": {\n            \"captions\": [\"G.W.Leibnitz (1646-1716)\"],\n            \"footnotes\": []\n        },\n        \"visual_elements\": [],\n        \"colors\": [\"monochrome or possibly sepia tone, as the image is a portrait from the 17th century\"],\n        \"lighting\": [\"natural light or studio lighting, but not specified\"],\n        \"style\": [\"traditional portrait style with a focus on the subject's face and attire\"],\n        \"actions_activities\": [],\n        \"technical_details\": []\n    },\n    \"entity_info\": {\n        \"entity_name\": \"Portrait of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\",\n        \"entity_type\": \"image\",\n        \"summary\": \"A portrait of German philosopher and mathematic", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e80862d06b97a302ca78d59d84c5958", "file_path": "kemh102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-a5e2af6ae4d884e4d04cecdb7ee72989", "__created_at__": 1770834658, "content": "Mathematical Equation Analysis:\nEquation: $$\nA = \\{r e d, b l u e \\} a n d B = \\{b, c, s \\},\n$$\nFormat: latex\n\nMathematical Analysis: {\n    \"detailed_description\": \"The given equation represents the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted as $A \\times B$. The Cartesian product is a fundamental concept in set theory that describes the set of all ordered pairs formed by taking one element from each of the two sets. In this context, set A consists of two elements: red and blue, representing colors, while set B comprises three elements: b, c, and s, representing specific objects (bag, coat, and shirt). The equation $A \\times B = \\{(red,b), (red,c), (red,s), (blue,b), (blue,c), (blue,s)\\}$ signifies that there are six distinct ordered pairs formed by combining each element of set A with each element of set B. This concept is crucial in mathematics as it enables the description of relationships between sets and their elements, which is essential for various mathematical operations and functions.\n\nThe equation also highlights the importance of order in forming ordered pairs. For instance, the pair $(red,b)$ is distinct from $(b, red)$. This distinction is critical in understanding the Cartesian product's role in defining functions, as it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity and another.\n\nFurthermore, the equation illustrates the application domain of the Cartesian product in real-world scenarios. In this case, the ordered pairs can represent colored objects, emphasizing the practical significance of set theory in describing relationships between sets and their elements.\n\nThe equation's relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context is that it builds upon the definition of an ordered pair and introduces the concept of the Cartesian product as a means of linking pairs of objects from two sets.

In this specific case, A × B is defined as {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}. This means that the elements of set A are paired with the elements of set B to form ordered pairs.\n\nThe equation can be interpreted in terms of relations and functions. Since A × B represents a relation from set A to set B, it is a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. The given relation R = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)} can be seen as a specific instance of this relation.\n\nIn terms of functions, the equation implies that there exists a function f from set A to set B such that f(1) = 3 and f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3 and f(2) = 4. However, since no two distinct ordered pairs in f have the same first element, this relation does not satisfy the definition of a function.\n\nThe equation's significance lies in its representation of the Cartesian product and relations between sets. It highlights the importance of understanding the properties of relations and functions in mathematics, particularly in the context of set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of mathematical operations and functions used, the equation involves the Cartesian product operation (×) and the concept of relations and functions. The equation also relies on the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation.\n\nThe application domain and context based on surrounding material are set theory and abstract algebra. The equation is relevant to understanding the properties of relations and functions in these areas.\n\nIn terms of physical or theoretical significance, the equation represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has numerous applications in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and physics.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context includes the definitions of domain, codomain, and range of a relation, as well as the concept of functions. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on set theory and abstract algebra.\n\nIn terms of practical applications or use cases, the equation has implications for understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science, as well as modeling real-world phenomena in physics and engineering.\n\nThe equation's significance within the broader framework is that it represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, which has far-reaching implications for various fields.

The modulus function $|x|$ returns the absolute value of $x$, which is equal to $x$ for non-negative values of $x$ and $-x$ for negative values of $x$. When dividing by $x$, we must consider two cases: when $x > 0$ and when $x < 0$. For $x > 0$, the function simplifies to $\frac{x}{x} = 1$, while for $x < 0$, it becomes $\frac{-x}{x} = -1$. At $x = 0$, we define $f(0) = 0$ by convention.

The result is a new function that combines the properties of both f and g. Additionally, the quotient of f by g, denoted as (f/g)(x), is also provided. This equation demonstrates the application of pointwise multiplication and division in real functions.\n\nThe mathematical meaning and interpretation of this equation involve understanding the concept of pointwise operations on functions. The product (f*g)(x) = √x * x results in a new function that can be simplified to x^(3/2). Similarly, the quotient (f/g)(x) = √x / x simplifies to x^(-1/2), which is valid for x ≠ 0.\n\nThe variables and their definitions are as follows: f(x) represents the square root of x, g(x) represents x itself, and the result of the product or quotient operation depends on these functions. The mathematical operations used include multiplication (pointwise) and division (pointwise).\n\nIn the context of real functions, this equation is significant because it illustrates how different pointwise operations can be applied to combine functions. This concept is crucial in various applications, such as signal processing, control systems, and data analysis.\n\nThe relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the surrounding material involves understanding the properties of real functions, including their domains, ranges, and pointwise operations. The equation also relates to the broader discussion on algebraic operations with real functions, which is a fundamental topic in mathematics.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include solving problems involving function composition, signal processing, and control systems. For instance, understanding how to combine functions through pointwise multiplication and division can help in designing filters, controllers, or other systems that rely on mathematical modeling.\n\nThe broader discussion or framework involves the study of real functions, their properties, and operations.

This function is defined by adding 10 to each input value, resulting in an output that is also a real number. The domain and range of this function are both the set of all real numbers, as it is defined for every possible input value.\n\nThe equation $f(x) = x + 10$ can be interpreted as a translation of the identity function by 10 units to the right. In other words, if we were to graph the identity function $y = x$, shifting it 10 units to the right would result in the graph of this linear function.\n\nThe mathematical operations and functions used in this equation are addition and scalar multiplication (in this case, multiplying each input value by 1). The application domain for this function is the set of all real numbers, as it is defined for every possible input value. This function has a physical or theoretical significance in that it represents a simple linear transformation, which can be used to model various real-world phenomena.\n\nIn terms of relationship to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context, this equation relates to the concept of functions and their properties, such as domain and range. It also relates to the concept of linear transformations and how they can be represented algebraically.\n\nPractical applications or use cases for this equation include modeling simple linear relationships between variables, such as the cost of an item based on its weight or price based on quantity. The equation $f(x) = x + 10$ is a fundamental building block in many mathematical models and has numerous practical applications in fields such as economics, physics, and engineering.\n\nThe equation relates to the broader discussion or framework by providing a basic example of a linear function, which can be used to model more complex relationships between variables. It also serves as a foundation for understanding more advanced concepts in mathematics, such as linear transformations and vector spaces.", "full_doc_id": "doc-7e80862d06b97a302ca78d59d84c5958", "file_path": "kemh102.pdf", "vector": "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"}, {"__id__": "chunk-698f6404c579ea765d5de0099c5edef6", "__created_at__": 1770834658, "content": "\nImage Content Analysis:\nImage Path: /workspace/Maths_XI/output/kemh102/hybrid_auto/images/272fc7951532c8f1e5948404796fcc406587c9dbf1f80dad5ae6ffd2a863527c.jpg\nCaptions: None\nFootnotes: None\n\nVisual Analysis: {\n    \"detailed_description\": {\n        \"composition_and_layout\": \"The image is a simple graph with a linear function represented by a straight line.

The real number $k$ mentioned in the surrounding context is not directly involved in this equation, but it is related to the concept of scalar multiplication of functions, which is discussed later.\n\nThe mathematical operation used here is subtraction, denoted by the minus sign ($-$). This operation is applied to the outputs of the two functions, resulting in a new function that represents their difference. The domain $X$ and codomain $\\mathrm{B}$ are sets that contain the possible inputs and outputs of the functions, respectively.\n\nIn the context of relations and functions, this equation highlights the importance of understanding how different functions can be combined to create new ones. It also demonstrates the concept of function subtraction, which is a fundamental operation in mathematics.\n\nThe historical note provided in the surrounding text highlights the development of the concept of functions by mathematicians such as Leibnitz and Bernoulli. The equation $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ represents a key aspect of this development, showcasing how functions can be manipulated and combined to create new mathematical objects.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, understanding function subtraction is crucial in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics. For instance, it can be used to model real-world phenomena, such as the difference between two physical quantities or the variation in a system over time.\n\nThe equation $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ also relates to other mathematical concepts mentioned in the context, such as scalar multiplication of functions and the concept of function composition. These ideas are essential in understanding how functions can be combined and manipulated to create new ones, which is a fundamental aspect of mathematics.\n\nIn conclusion, the given equation represents a fundamental concept in mathematics, specifically in the study of relations and functions.
