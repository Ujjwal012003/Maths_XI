HARDY \n\n1.1 Introduction \n\nThe concept of set serves as a fundamental part of the present day mathematics. Today this concept is being used in almost every branch of mathematics. Sets are used to define the concepts of relations and functions. The study of geometry, sequences, probability, etc. requires the knowledge of sets. \n\nThe theory of sets was developed by German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). He first encountered sets while working on \"problems on trigonometric series\". In this Chapter, we discuss some basic definitions and operations involving sets. \n\n1.2 Sets and their Representations \n\nIn everyday life, we often speak of collections of objects of a particular kind, such as, a pack of cards, a crowd of people, a cricket team, etc. In mathematics also, we come across collections, for example, of natural numbers, points, prime numbers, etc. More specially, we examine the following collections: \n\nWe note that each of the above example is a well-defined collection of objects in \n\nthe sense that we can definitely decide whether a given particular object belongs to a given collection or not. For example, we can say that the river Nile does not belong to the collection of rivers of India. On the other hand, the river Ganga does belong to this collection. \n\nWe give below a few more examples of sets used particularly in mathematics, viz. \n\nN : the set of all natural numbers \n\nZ : the set of all integers \n\nQ : the set of all rational numbers \n\nR : the set of real numbers \n\n$\\mathbf{Z}^{+}$ : the set of positive integers \n\n$\\mathbf{Q}^{+}$ : the set of positive rational numbers, and \n\n$\\mathbf{R}^{+}$ : the set of positive real numbers. \n\nThe symbols for the special sets given above will be referred to throughout this text. \n\nAgain the collection of five most renowned mathematicians of the world is not well-defined, because the criterion for determining a mathematician as most renowned may vary from person to person. Thus, it is not a well-defined collection. \n\nWe shall say that a set is a well-defined collection of objects. \n\nThe following points may be noted : \n\nIf $a$ is an element of a set $A$ , we say that \" $a$ belongs to $A$ \" the Greek symbol $\\in$ (epsilon) is used to denote the phrase \"belongs to\". Thus, we write $a \\in A$ . If \" $b$ \" is not an element of a set $A$ , we write $b \\notin A$ and read \" $b$ does not belong to $A$ \". \n\nThus, in the set $\\mathrm{V}$ of vowels in the English alphabet, $a \\in \\mathrm{V}$ but $b \\notin \\mathrm{V}$ . In the set $\\mathrm{P}$ of prime factors of 30, $3 \\in \\mathrm{P}$ but $15 \\notin \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nThere are two methods of representing a set : \n\n(i) In roster form, all the elements of a set are listed, the elements are being separated by commas and are enclosed within braces $\\{\\}$ . For example, the set of all even positive integers less than 7 is described in roster form as $\\{2, 4, 6\\}$ . Some more examples of representing a set in roster form are given below: \n\n(a) The set of all natural numbers which divide 42 is $\\{1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42\\}$ \n\nNote In roster form, the order in which the elements are listed is immaterial. \n\nThus, the above set can also be represented as $\\{1,3,7,21,2,6,14,42\\}$ . \n\nNote It may be noted that while writing the set in roster form an element is not generally repeated, i.e., all the elements are taken as distinct. For example, the set of letters forming the word 'SCHOOL' is $\\{S, C, H, O, L\\}$ or $\\{H, O, L, C, S\\}$ . Here, the order of listing elements has no relevance. \n\n(ii) In set-builder form, all the elements of a set possess a single common property which is not possessed by any element outside the set. For example, in the set $\\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ , all the elements possess a common property, namely, each of them is a vowel in the English alphabet, and no other letter possesses this property. Denoting this set by V, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{V} = \\{x:x$ is a vowel in English alphabet} \n\nIt may be observed that we describe the element of the set by using a symbol $x$ (any other symbol like the letters $y$ , $z$ , etc. could be used) which is followed by a colon “:”. After the sign of colon, we write the characteristic property possessed by the elements of the set and then enclose the whole description within braces. The above description of the set $\\mathrm{V}$ is read as “the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a vowel of the English alphabet”. In this description the braces stand for “the set of all”, the colon stands for “such that”. For example, the set \n\n$A = \\{x : x \\text{ is a natural number and } 3 < x < 10\\}$ is read as \"the set of all $x$ such that $x$ is a natural number and $x$ lies between 3 and 10.\" Hence, the numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are the elements of the set $A$ . \n\nIf we denote the sets described in $(a)$ , $(b)$ and $(c)$ above in roster form by A, B, C, respectively, then A, B, C can also be represented in set-builder form as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a natural number which divides 42} \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\text{is a vowel in the English alphabet}\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{C} = \\{z:z$ is an odd natural number} \n\nExample 1 Write the solution set of the equation $x^{2} + x - 2 = 0$ in roster form. \n\nSolution The given equation can be written as \n\nTherefore, the solution set of the given equation can be written in roster form as $\\{1, -2\\}$ . \n\nExample 2 Write the set $\\{x : x \\text{ is a positive integer and } x^2 < 40\\}$ in the roster form. \n\nSolution The required numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the given set in the roster form is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ . \n\nExample 3 Write the set $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \\ldots\\}$ in set-builder form. \n\nSolution We may write the set $\\mathrm{A}$ as \n\nAlternatively, we can write \n\nExample 4 Write the set $\\{\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{5}{6}, \\frac{6}{7}\\}$ in the set-builder form. \n\nSolution We see that each member in the given set has the numerator one less than the denominator. Also, the numerator begins from 1 and does not exceed 6. Hence, in the set-builder form the given set is \n\nExample 5 Match each of the set on the left described in the roster form with the same set on the right described in the set-builder form : \n\nSolution Since in (d), there are 9 letters in the word PRINCIPAL and two letters P and I are repeated, so (i) matches (d). Similarly, (ii) matches (c) as $x + 1 = 1$ implies $x = 0$ . Also, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 are all divisors of 18 and so (iii) matches (a). Finally, $x^2 - 9 = 0$ implies $x = 3, -3$ and so (iv) matches (b). \n\nEXERCISE 1.1 \n\n1. Which of the following are sets? Justify your answer. \n\n2. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ . Insert the appropriate symbol $\\in$ or $\\notin$ in the blank spaces: \n\n(i) 5..A \n\n(ii) 8...A \n\n(iii) 0..A \n\n(iv) 4...A \n\n(v) 2..A \n\n(vi) 10..A \n\n3. Write the following sets in roster form: \n\n4. Write the following sets in the set-builder form : \n\n(i) $(3,6,9,12)$ \n\n(ii) $\\{2,4,8,16,32\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\{5,25,125,625\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\{2,4,6,\\ldots \\}$ \n\n(v) $\\{1,4,9,\\dots,100\\}$ \n\n5. List all the elements of the following sets : \n\n6. Match each of the set on the left in the roster form with the same set on the right described in set-builder form: \n\n(i) $\\{1,2,3,6\\}$ \n\n(a) $\\{x:x$ is a prime number and a divisor of 6\\} \n\n(ii) $\\{2,3\\}$ \n\n(b) $\\{x:x$ is an odd natural number less than 10\\} \n\n(iii) $\\{\\mathrm{M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}\\}$ \n\n(c) $\\{x:x$ is natural number and divisor of 6\\} \n\n(iv) $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$ \n\n(d) $\\{x:x$ is a letter of the word MATHEMATICS\\}. \n\n1.3 The Empty Set \n\nConsider the set \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{x:x$ is a student of Class XI presently studying in a school \\} \n\nWe can go to the school and count the number of students presently studying in Class XI in the school. Thus, the set A contains a finite number of elements. \n\nWe now write another set B as follows: \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x$ is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI $\\}$ \n\nWe observe that a student cannot study simultaneously in both Classes X and XI. Thus, the set B contains no element at all. \n\nDefinition 1 A set which does not contain any element is called the empty set or the null set or the void set. \n\nAccording to this definition, B is an empty set while A is not an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol $\\phi$ or $\\{\\}$ . \n\nWe give below a few examples of empty sets. \n\n1.4 Finite and Infinite Sets \n\nLet $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} ,\\qquad \\mathrm{B} = \\{a,b,c,d,e,g\\}$ \n\nand $C = \\{\\text{men living presently in different parts of the world}\\}$ \n\nWe observe that A contains 5 elements and B contains 6 elements. How many elements does C contain? As it is, we do not know the number of elements in C, but it is some natural number which may be quite a big number. By number of elements of a set S, we mean the number of distinct elements of the set and we denote it by $n$ (S). If $n$ (S) is a natural number, then S is non-empty finite set. \n\nConsider the set of natural numbers. We see that the number of elements of this set is not finite since there are infinite numbers of natural numbers. We say that the set of natural numbers is an infinite set. The sets A, B and C given above are finite sets and $n(\\mathrm{A}) = 5$ , $n(\\mathrm{B}) = 6$ and $n(\\mathrm{C}) =$ some finite number. \n\nDefinition 2 A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite. \n\nConsider some examples : \n\nWhen we represent a set in the roster form, we write all the elements of the set within braces $\\{\\}$ . It is not possible to write all the elements of an infinite set within braces $\\{\\}$ because the numbers of elements of such a set is not finite. So, we represent \n\nsome infinite set in the roster form by writing a few elements which clearly indicate the structure of the set followed ( or preceded ) by three dots. \n\nFor example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of natural numbers, $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of odd natural numbers, $\\{.\\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of integers. All these sets are infinite. \n\nNote All infinite sets cannot be described in the roster form. For example, the set of real numbers cannot be described in this form, because the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern. \n\nExample 6 State which of the following sets are finite or infinite : \n\nSolution (i) Given set $= \\{1,2\\}$ . Hence, it is finite. \n\n1.5 Equal Sets \n\nGiven two sets A and B, if every element of A is also an element of B and if every element of B is also an element of A, then the sets A and B are said to be equal. Clearly, the two sets have exactly the same elements. \n\nDefinition 3 Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nWe consider the following examples : \n\nNote A set does not change if one or more elements of the set are repeated. \n\nFor example, the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 2, 1, 3, 3\\}$ are equal, since each \n\nelement of A is in B and vice-versa. That is why we generally do not repeat any element in describing a set. \n\nExample 7 Find the pairs of equal sets, if any, give reasons: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{0\\}$ \n\n$\\mathrm{E} = \\{x:x$ is an integral positive root of the equation $x^{2} - 2x - 15 = 0\\}$ \n\nSolution Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0$ does not belong to any of the sets $\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ , it follows that, $\\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{A} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ but none of the other sets are empty. Therefore $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{C}$ , $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Also $\\mathrm{C} = \\{5\\}$ but $-5 \\in \\mathrm{D}$ , hence $\\mathrm{C} \\neq \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\nSince $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{E}$ . Further, $\\mathrm{D} = \\{-5, 5\\}$ and $\\mathrm{E} = \\{5\\}$ , we find that, $\\mathrm{D} \\neq \\mathrm{E}$ . Thus, the only pair of equal sets is $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ . \n\nExample 8 Which of the following pairs of sets are equal? Justify your answer. \n\nSolution (i) We have, $\\mathrm{X} = \\{\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{Y}\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{\\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{Y}, \\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{L}\\}$ . Then $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are equal sets as repetition of elements in a set do not change a set. Thus, \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1, 2\\}$ . Since $0 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $0 \\notin \\mathrm{B}$ , $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are not equal sets. \n\nEXERCISE 1.2 \n\n1. Which of the following are examples of the null set \n\n2. Which of the following sets are finite or infinite \n\n3. State whether each of the following set is finite or infinite: \n\n4. In the following, state whether $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ or not: \n\n5. Are the following pair of sets equal? Give reasons. \n\n$\\mathrm{B} = \\{y:y\\mathrm{is a}$ letter in the word WOLF} \n\n6. From the sets given below, select equal sets : \n\n1.6 Subsets \n\nConsider the sets: $X =$ set of all students in your school, $Y =$ set of all students in your class. \n\nWe note that every element of $\\mathrm{Y}$ is also an element of $\\mathrm{X}$ ; we say that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ . The fact that $\\mathrm{Y}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{X}$ is expressed in symbols as $\\mathrm{Y} \\subset \\mathrm{X}$ . The symbol $\\subset$ stands for 'is a subset of' or 'is contained in'. \n\nDefinition 4 A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. \n\nIn other words, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ if whenever $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ , then $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . It is often convenient to use the symbol “ $\\Rightarrow$ ” which means implies. Using this symbol, we can write the definition of subset as follows: \n\nWe read the above statement as \"A is a subset of $B$ if a is an element of $A$ implies that a is also an element of $B$ \". If A is not a subset of B, we write A $\\nsubseteq$ B. \n\nWe may note that for A to be a subset of B, all that is needed is that every element of A is in B. It is possible that every element of B may or may not be in A. If it so happens that every element of B is also in A, then we shall also have B ⊆ A. In this case, A and B are the same sets so that we have A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A ⇌ A = B, where “ $\\Leftrightarrow$ ” is a symbol for two way implications, and is usually read as if and only if (briefly written as “iff”). \n\nIt follows from the above definition that every set $A$ is a subset of itself, i.e., $A \\subset A$ . Since the empty set $\\phi$ has no elements, we agree to say that $\\phi$ is a subset of every set. We now consider some examples: \n\nLet A and B be two sets. If $\\mathrm{A}\\subset \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{A}\\neq \\mathrm{B}$ , then A is called a proper subset of B and B is called superset of A. For example, \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ is a proper subset of $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ . \n\nIf a set $A$ has only one element, we call it a singleton set. Thus, $\\{a\\}$ is a singleton set. \n\nExample 9 Consider the sets \n\nInsert the symbol $\\subset$ or $\\nsubseteq$ between each of the following pair of sets: \n\n(i) $\\phi \\dots \\mathrm{B}$ \n\n(ii) A...B \n\n(iii) A...C \n\n(iv) B. .C \n\nSolution (i) $\\phi \\subset \\mathbf{B}$ as $\\phi$ is a subset of every set. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ . Is $\\mathrm{A}$ a subset of $\\mathrm{B}$ ? No. (Why?). Is $\\mathrm{B}$ a subset of $\\mathrm{A}$ ? No. (Why?) \n\nExample 11 Let A, B and C be three sets. If A $\\in$ B and B $\\subset$ C, is it true that A $\\subset$ C?. If not, give an example. \n\nSolution No. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{\\{1\\}, 2\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{\\{1\\}, 2, 3\\}$ . Here $\\mathrm{A} \\in \\mathrm{B}$ as $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{C}$ . But $\\mathrm{A} \\not\\subset \\mathrm{C}$ as $1 \\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $1 \\not\\in \\mathrm{C}$ . \n\nNote that an element of a set can never be a subset of itself. \n\n1.6.1 Subsets of set of real numbers \n\nAs noted in Section 1.6, there are many important subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ . We give below the names of some of these subsets. \n\nThe set of natural numbers $\\mathbf{N} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,\\ldots \\}$ \n\nThe set of integers $\\mathbf{Z} = \\{ \\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots \\}$ \n\nThe set of rational numbers $\\mathbf{Q} = \\{x : x = \\frac{p}{q}, p, q \\in \\mathbf{Z}$ and $q \\neq 0\\}$ \n\nwhich is read “ $\\mathbf{Q}$ is the set of all numbers $x$ such that $x$ equals the quotient $\\frac{p}{q}$ , where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q$ is not zero”. Members of $\\mathbf{Q}$ include $-5$ (which can be expressed as $-\\frac{5}{1}$ , $\\frac{5}{7}$ , $\\frac{3}{2}$ ) (which can be expressed as $\\frac{7}{2}$ ) and $-\\frac{11}{3}$ . \n\nThe set of irrational numbers, denoted by $\\mathbf{T}$ , is composed of all other real numbers. Thus $\\mathbf{T} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R} \\text{ and } x \\notin \\mathbf{Q}\\}$ , i.e., all real numbers that are not rational. Members of $\\mathbf{T}$ include $\\sqrt{2}$ , $\\sqrt{5}$ and $\\pi$ . \n\nSome of the obvious relations among these subsets are: \n\n1.6.2 Intervals as subsets of $R$ Let $a, b \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $a < b$ . Then the set of real numbers $\\{y : a < y < b\\}$ is called an open interval and is denoted by $(a, b)$ . All the points between $a$ and $b$ belong to the open interval $(a, b)$ but $a, b$ themselves do not belong to this interval. \n\nThe interval which contains the end points also is called closed interval and is denoted by $[a, b]$ . Thus \n\nWe can also have intervals closed at one end and open at the other, i.e., \n\n$[a, b) = \\{x : a \\leq x < b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ , including $a$ but excluding $b$ . \n\n$(a,b] = \\{x:a < x\\leq b\\}$ is an open interval from $a$ to $b$ including $b$ but excluding $a$ \n\nThese notations provide an alternative way of designating the subsets of set of real numbers. For example, if $A = (-3, 5)$ and $B = [-7, 9]$ , then $A \\subset B$ . The set $[0, \\infty)$ defines the set of non-negative real numbers, while set $(-\\infty, 0)$ defines the set of negative real numbers. The set $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ describes the set of real numbers in relation to a line extending from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ . \n\nOn real number line, various types of intervals described above as subsets of $\\mathbf{R}$ , are shown in the Fig 1.1. \n\nHere, we note that an interval contains infinitely many points. \n\nFor example, the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}, -5 < x \\leq 7\\}$ , written in set-builder form, can be written in the form of interval as $(-5, 7]$ and the interval $[-3, 5)$ can be written in set-builder form as $\\{x : -3 \\leq x < 5\\}$ . \n\nThe number $(b - a)$ is called the length of any of the intervals $(a, b)$ , $[a, b]$ , $[a, b)$ or $(a, b]$ . \n\n1.7 Universal Set \n\nUsually, in a particular context, we have to deal with the elements and subsets of a basic set which is relevant to that particular context. For example, while studying the system of numbers, we are interested in the set of natural numbers and its subsets such as the set of all prime numbers, the set of all even numbers, and so forth. This basic set is called the \"Universal Set\". The universal set is usually denoted by U, and all its subsets by the letters A, B, C, etc. \n\nFor example, for the set of all integers, the universal set can be the set of rational numbers or, for that matter, the set $\\mathbf{R}$ of real numbers. For another example, in human population studies, the universal set consists of all the people in the world. \n\nEXERCISE 1.3 \n\n1. Make correct statements by filling in the symbols $\\subset$ or $\\nsubseteq$ in the blank spaces : \n\n2. Examine whether the following statements are true or false: \n\n3. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,\\{3,4\\},5\\}$ . Which of the following statements are incorrect and why? \n\n(i) $\\{3,4\\} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(ii) $\\{3,4\\} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(iii) $\\{\\{3,4\\} \\} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(iv) $1\\in \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(v) $1\\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(vi) $\\{1,2,5\\} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(vii) $\\{1,2,5\\} \\in \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(viii) $\\{1,2,3\\} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(ix) $\\phi \\in \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(x) $\\phi \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n(xi) $\\{\\phi \\} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ \n\n4. Write down all the subsets of the following sets \n\n(i) $\\{a\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\{a,b\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\{1,2,3\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\phi$ \n\n5. Write the following as intervals : \n\n(i) $\\{x:x\\in \\mathbb{R}, - 4 <   x\\leq 6\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\{x:x\\in \\mathbb{R}, - 12 <   x <   - 10\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\{x:x\\in \\mathbb{R},0\\leq x <   7\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{R},3\\leq x\\leq 4\\}$ \n\n6. Write the following intervals in set-builder form : \n\n(i) $(-3,0)$ \n\n(ii) [6, 12] \n\n(iii) (6, 12] \n\n(iv) [-23, 5) \n\n7. What universal set(s) would you propose for each of the following : \n\n(i) The set of right triangles. \n\n(ii) The set of isosceles triangles. \n\n8. Given the sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$ , which of the following may be considered as universal set (s) for all the three sets $\\mathrm{A}$ , $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ \n\n1.8 Venn Diagrams \n\nMost of the relationships between sets can be represented by means of diagrams which are known as Venn diagrams. Venn diagrams are named after the English logician, John Venn (1834-1883). These diagrams consist of rectangles and closed curves usually circles. The universal set is represented usually by a rectangle and its subsets by circles. \n\nIn Venn diagrams, the elements of the sets are written in their respective circles (Figs 1.2 and 1.3) \n\nIllustration 1 In Fig 1.2, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ is a subset. \n\nIllustration 2 In Fig 1.3, $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,10\\}$ is the universal set of which \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8,10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{4,6\\}$ are subsets, and also $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThe reader will see an extensive use of the Venn diagrams when we discuss the union, intersection and difference of sets. \n\n1.9 Operations on Sets \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers. Each one of these operations was performed on a pair of numbers to get another number. For example, when we perform the operation of addition on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get the number 18. Again, performing the operation of multiplication on the pair of numbers 5 and 13, we get 65. \n\nSimilarly, there are some operations which when performed on two sets give rise to another set. We will now define certain operations on sets and examine their properties. Henceforth, we will refer all our sets as subsets of some universal set. \n\n1.9.1 Union of sets Let A and B be any two sets. The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B, the common elements being taken only once. The symbol $\\cup$ is used to denote the union. Symbolically, we write A $\\cup$ B and usually read as 'A union B'. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{6, 8, 10, 12\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSolution We have $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\\}$ \n\nNote that the common elements 6 and 8 have been taken only once while writing A $\\cup$ B. \n\nExample 13 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{a, i, u\\}$ . Show that $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nSolution We have, $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\{a, e, i, o, u\\} = \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nThis example illustrates that union of sets A and its subset B is the set A itself, i.e., if B $\\subset$ A, then $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nExample 14 Let $\\mathrm{X} = \\{\\mathrm{Ram}, \\mathrm{Geeta}, \\mathrm{Akbar}\\}$ be the set of students of Class XI, who are in school hockey team. Let $\\mathrm{Y} = \\{\\mathrm{Geeta}, \\mathrm{David}, \\mathrm{Ashok}\\}$ be the set of students from Class XI who are in the school football team. Find $\\mathrm{X} \\cup \\mathrm{Y}$ and interpret the set. \n\nSolution We have, $\\mathrm{X} \\cup \\mathrm{Y} = \\{\\mathrm{Ram}, \\mathrm{Geeta}, \\mathrm{Akbar}, \\mathrm{David}, \\mathrm{Ashok}\\}$ . This is the set of students from Class XI who are in the hockey team or the football team or both. \n\nThus, we can define the union of two sets as follows: \n\nDefinition 5 The union of two sets A and B is the set C which consists of all those \n\nelements which are either in A or in B (including those which are in both). In symbols, we write. $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{A}$ or $x\\in \\mathrm{B}\\}$ \n\nThe union of two sets can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.4. \n\nThe shaded portion in Fig 1.4 represents $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSome Properties of the Operation of Union \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{A}$ (Commutative law) \n\n(ii) $(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B}) \\cup \\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{A} \\cup (\\mathrm{B} \\cup \\mathrm{C})$ \n\n(Associative law) \n\n(iii) $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\phi = \\mathrm{A}$ (Law of identity element, $\\phi$ is the identity of $\\cup$ \n\n1.9.2 Intersection of sets The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common to both A and B. The symbol \\(\\cap\\) is used to denote the intersection. The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically, we write A \\(\\cap\\) B = \\{x : x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}\\). \n\nExample 15 Consider the sets A and B of Example 12. Find A $\\cap$ B. \n\nSolution We see that 6, 8 are the only elements which are common to both A and B. Hence $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{6, 8\\}$ . \n\nExample 16 Consider the sets X and Y of Example 14. Find X $\\cap$ Y. \n\nSolution We see that element 'Geeta' is the only element common to both. Hence, $\\mathrm{X} \\cap \\mathrm{Y} = \\{\\mathrm{Geeta}\\}$ . \n\nExample 17 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ and hence show that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSolution We have $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{2, 3, 5, 7\\} = \\mathrm{B}$ . We note that $\\mathrm{B} \\subset \\mathrm{A}$ and that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nDefinition 6 The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which belong to both A and B. Symbolically, we write \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{A}$ and $x\\in \\mathrm{B}\\}$ \n\nThe shaded portion in Fig 1.5 indicates the intersection of A and B. \n\nIf A and B are two sets such that $\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B} = \\phi$ , then A and B are called disjoint sets. \n\nFor example, let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1,3,5,7\\}$ . Then A and B are disjoint sets, because there are no elements which are common to A and B. The disjoint sets can be represented by means of Venn diagram as shown in the Fig 1.6 In the above diagram, A and B are disjoint sets. \n\nSome Properties of Operation of Intersection \n\n(v) $\\mathrm{A}\\cap (\\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{C}) = (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B})\\cup (\\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{C})$ (Distributive law) i.e., $\\cap$ distributes over $\\cup$ \n\nThis can be seen easily from the following Venn diagrams [Figs 1.7 (i) to (v)]. \n\n1.9.3 Difference of sets The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not to B. Symbolically, we write A - B and read as \"A minus B\". \n\nExample 18 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A} - \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nSolution We have, $\\mathrm{A} - \\mathrm{B} = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$ , since the elements 1, 3, 5 belong to A but not to B and $\\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{A} = \\{8\\}$ , since the element 8 belongs to B and not to A. \n\nWe note that $\\mathrm{A} - \\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 19 Let $\\mathrm{V} = \\{a, e, i, o, u\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{a, i, k, u\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{V} - \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{V}$ \n\nSolution We have, $\\mathrm{V} - \\mathrm{B} = \\{e, o\\}$ , since the elements $e, o$ belong to $\\mathrm{V}$ but not to $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{V} = \\{k\\}$ , since the element $k$ belongs to $\\mathrm{B}$ but not to $\\mathrm{V}$ . \n\nWe note that $\\mathrm{V} - \\mathrm{B} \\neq \\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{V}$ . Using the set-builder notation, we can rewrite the definition of difference as \n\nThe difference of two sets A and B can be represented by Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.8. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the difference of the two sets A and B. \n\nRemark The sets $\\mathrm{A} - \\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{B} - \\mathrm{A}$ are mutually disjoint sets, i.e., the intersection of any of these two sets is the null set as shown in Fig 1.9. \n\nEXERCISE 1.4 \n\n1.

If $\\mathrm{X} = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Y} = \\{f, b, d, g\\}$ , find \n\n(i) $X - Y$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{Y - X}$ \n\n(iii) $X\\cap Y$ \n\n1.10 Complement of a Set \n\nLet $\\mathrm{U}$ be the universal set which consists of all prime numbers and $\\mathrm{A}$ be the subset of $\\mathrm{U}$ which consists of all those prime numbers that are not divisors of 42. Thus, $\\mathrm{A} = \\{x : x \\in \\mathrm{U} \\text{ and } x \\text{ is not a divisor of 42}\\}$ . We see that $2 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $2 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , because 2 is divisor of 42. Similarly, $3 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $3 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ , and $7 \\in \\mathrm{U}$ but $7 \\notin \\mathrm{A}$ . Now 2, 3 and 7 are the only elements of $\\mathrm{U}$ which do not belong to $\\mathrm{A}$ . The set of these three prime numbers, i.e., the set $\\{2, 3, 7\\}$ is called the Complement of $\\mathrm{A}$ with respect to $\\mathrm{U}$ , and is denoted by $\\mathrm{A}'$ . So we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$ . Thus, we see that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . This leads to the following definition. \n\nDefinition 7 Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. Symbolically, we write A' to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus, \n\n$\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\notin \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Obviously $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{U} - \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nWe note that the complement of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be looked upon, alternatively, as the difference between a universal set $\\mathrm{U}$ and the set $\\mathrm{A}$ . \n\nExample 20 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}$ and $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$ . Find $\\mathrm{A}'$ . \n\nSolution We note that 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are the only elements of U which do not belong to A. Hence $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ . \n\nExample 21 Let U be universal set of all the students of Class XI of a coeducational school and A be the set of all girls in Class XI. Find A'. \n\nSolution Since A is the set of all girls, $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}$ is clearly the set of all boys in the class. \n\nNote If A is a subset of the universal set U, then its complement A' is also a subset of U. \n\nAgain in Example 20 above, we have $\\mathrm{A}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}$ \n\nHence $(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime})^{\\prime} = \\{x:x\\in \\mathrm{U}$ and $x\\not\\in\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\}$ \n\nIt is clear from the definition of the complement that for any subset of the universal \n\nset U, we have $\\left(\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{A}$ \n\nNow, we want to find the results for $(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})'$ and $\\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ in the following example. \n\nExample 22 Let $\\mathrm{U} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ , $\\mathrm{A} = \\{2, 3\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$ . \n\nFind $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime},\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B}$ and hence show that $(\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B})^{\\prime} = \\mathrm{A}^{\\prime}\\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime}$ \n\nSolution Clearly $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 4, 5, 6\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 2, 6\\}$ . Hence $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\cap \\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} = \\{1, 6\\}$ . \n\nAlso $\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\{2,3,4,5\\}$ , so that $(\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\{1,6\\}$ \n\nIt can be shown that the above result is true in general. If A and B are any two subsets of the universal set U, then \n\n$(\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cap \\mathrm{B}'$ . Similarly, $(\\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B})' = \\mathrm{A}' \\cup \\mathrm{B}'$ . These two results are stated in words as follows: \n\nThe complement of the union of two sets is the intersection of their complements and the complement of the intersection of two sets is the union of their complements. These are called De Morgan's laws. These are named after the mathematician De Morgan. \n\nThe complement $\\mathrm{A}'$ of a set $\\mathrm{A}$ can be represented by a Venn diagram as shown in Fig 1.10. \n\nThe shaded portion represents the complement of the set A. \n\nSome Properties of Complement Sets \n\nThese laws can be verified by using Venn diagrams. \n\nEXERCISE 1.5 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ \n\n(ii) $\\mathrm{B} = \\{d,e,f,g\\}$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathbf{C} = \\{a,c,e,g\\}$ \n\n(iv) $\\mathrm{D} = \\{f,g,h,a\\}$ \n\n3.

Then \n\nLet $Y$ be the set of letters in \"TRACT\". Then \n\nSince every element in $X$ is in $Y$ and every element in $Y$ is in $X$ .

The subsets of $A$ having one element are $\\{-1\\}$ , $\\{0\\}$ , $\\{1\\}$ . The subsets of $A$ having two elements are $\\{-1, 0\\}$ , $\\{-1, 1\\}$ , $\\{0, 1\\}$ . The subset of $A$ having three elements of $A$ is $A$ itself. So, all the subsets of $A$ are $\\phi$ , $\\{-1\\}$ , $\\{0\\}$ , $\\{1\\}$ , $\\{-1, 0\\}$ , $\\{-1, 1\\}$ , $\\{0, 1\\}$ and $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ . \n\nExample 25 Show that $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ implies $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSolution Let $a \\in \\mathrm{A}$ . Then $a \\in \\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B}$ . Since $\\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ , $a \\in \\mathrm{A} \\cap \\mathrm{B}$ . So $a \\in \\mathrm{B}$ . Therefore, $\\mathrm{A} \\subset \\mathrm{B}$ . Similarly, if $b \\in \\mathrm{B}$ , then $b \\in \\mathrm{A} \\cup \\mathrm{B}$ . Since \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\cup \\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B},b\\in \\mathrm{A}\\cap \\mathrm{B}.$ So, $b\\in \\mathrm{A}$ . Therefore, $\\mathrm{B}\\subset \\mathrm{A}$ .

Find sets $A, B$ and $C$ such that $A \\cap B, B \\cap C$ and $A \\cap C$ are non-empty sets and $A \\cap B \\cap C = \\phi$ . \n\nSummary \n\nThis chapter deals with some basic definitions and operations involving sets. These are summarised below: \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe modern theory of sets is considered to have been originated largely by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His papers on set theory appeared sometimes during 1874 to 1897. His study of set theory came when he was studying trigonometric series of the form $a_1 \\sin x + a_2 \\sin 2x + a_3 \\sin 3x + \\ldots$ . He published in a paper in 1874 that the set of real numbers could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. From 1879 onwards, he published several papers showing various properties of abstract sets. \n\nCantor's work was well received by another famous mathematician Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). But Kronecker (1810-1893) castigated him for regarding infinite set the same way as finite sets. Another German mathematician Gottlob Frege, at the turn of the century, presented the set theory as principles of logic. Till then the entire set theory was based on the assumption of the existence of the set of all sets. It was the famous English Philosopher Bertand Russell (1872-1970) who showed in 1902 that the assumption of existence of a set of all sets leads to a contradiction. This led to the famous Russell's Paradox. Paul R. Halmos writes about it in his book 'Naïve Set Theory' that \"nothing contains everything\". \n\nThe Russell's Paradox was not the only one which arose in set theory. Many paradoxes were produced later by several mathematicians and logicians. As a consequence of all these paradoxes, the first axiomatisation of set theory was published in 1908 by Ernst Zermelo. Another one was proposed by Abraham Fraenkel in 1922. John Von Neumann in 1925 introduced explicitly the axiom of regularity. Later in 1937 Paul Bernays gave a set of more satisfactory axiomatisation. A modification of these axioms was done by Kurt Gödel in his monograph in 1940. This was known as Von Neumann-Bernays (VNB) or Gödel-Bernays (GB) set theory. \n\nDespite all these difficulties, Cantor's set theory is used in present day mathematics. In fact, these days most of the concepts and results in mathematics are expressed in the set theoretic language.",

    "content": "RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS \n\nMathematics is the indispensable instrument of all physical research. - BERTHELOT \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nMuch of mathematics is about finding a pattern - a recognisable link between quantities that change. In our daily life, we come across many patterns that characterise relations such as brother and sister, father and son, teacher and student. In mathematics also, we come across many relations such as number $m$ is less than number $n$ , line $l$ is parallel to line $m$ , set A is a subset of set B. In all these, we notice that a relation involves pairs of objects in certain order. In this Chapter, we will learn how to link pairs of objects from two sets and then introduce relations between the two objects in the pair. Finally, we will learn about special relations which will qualify to be functions. The \n\nconcept of function is very important in mathematics since it captures the idea of a mathematically precise correspondence between one quantity with the other. \n\n2.2 Cartesian Products of Sets \n\nSuppose A is a set of 2 colours and B is a set of 3 objects, i.e., \n\nwhere $b, c$ and $s$ represent a particular bag, coat and shirt, respectively. \n\nHow many pairs of coloured objects can be made from these two sets? \n\nProceeding in a very orderly manner, we can see that there will be 6 distinct pairs as given below: \n\n(red, $b$ ), (red, $c$ ), (red, $s$ ), (blue, $b$ ), (blue, $c$ ), (blue, $s$ ). \n\nThus, we get 6 distinct objects (Fig 2.1). \n\nLet us recall from our earlier classes that an ordered pair of elements taken from any two sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ is a pair of elements written in small \n\nbrackets and grouped together in a particular order, i.e., $(p,q), p \\in \\mathrm{P}$ and $q \\in \\mathrm{Q}$ . This leads to the following definition: \n\nDefinition 1 Given two non-empty sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . The cartesian product $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of elements from $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ , i.e., \n\nIf either $\\mathrm{P}$ or $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the null set, then $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ will also be empty set, i.e., $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\phi$ \n\nFrom the illustration given above we note that \n\n$\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(\\mathrm{red},b),(\\mathrm{red},c),(\\mathrm{red},s),(\\mathrm{blue},b),(\\mathrm{blue},c),(\\mathrm{blue},s)\\} .$ \n\nAgain, consider the two sets: \n\n$\\mathrm{A} = \\{\\mathrm{DL}, \\mathrm{MP}, \\mathrm{KA}\\}$ , where DL, MP, KA represent Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, respectively and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{01,02,03\\}$ representing codes for the licence plates of vehicles issued by DL, MP and KA. \n\nIf the three states, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were making codes for the licence plates of vehicles, with the restriction that the code begins with an element from set A, which are the pairs available from these sets and how many such pairs will there be (Fig 2.2)? \n\nThe available pairs are: (DL,01), (DL,02), (DL,03), (MP,01), (MP,02), (MP,03), (KA,01), (KA,02), (KA,03) and the product of set A and set B is given by \n\nIt can easily be seen that there will be 9 such pairs in the Cartesian product, since there are 3 elements in each of the sets A and B. This gives us 9 possible codes. Also note that the order in which these elements are paired is crucial. For example, the code (DL, 01) will not be the same as the code (01, DL). \n\nAs a final illustration, consider the two sets $\\mathrm{A} = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and \n\nThe 8 ordered pairs thus formed can represent the position of points in the plane if A and B are subsets of the set of real numbers and it is obvious that the point in the position $(a_{1}, b_{2})$ will be distinct from the point in the position $(b_{2}, a_{1})$ . \n\nRemarks \n\n(i) Two ordered pairs are equal, if and only if the corresponding first elements are equal and the second elements are also equal. \n\nExample 1 If $(x + 1, y - 2) = (3, 1)$ , find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution Since the ordered pairs are equal, the corresponding elements are equal. \n\nTherefore $x + 1 = 3$ and $y - 2 = 1$ \n\nSolving we get $x = 2$ and $y = 3$ . \n\nExample 2 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a, b, c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{r\\}$ , form the sets $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nAre these two products equal? \n\nSolution By the definition of the cartesian product, \n\nSince, by the definition of equality of ordered pairs, the pair $(a, r)$ is not equal to the pair $(r, a)$ , we conclude that $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} \\neq \\mathrm{Q} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nHowever, the number of elements in each set will be the same. \n\nExample 3 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3,4\\}$ and $\\mathrm{C} = \\{4,5,6\\}$ . Find \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A}\\times (\\mathrm{B}\\cap \\mathrm{C})$ \n\n(ii) $(\\mathbf{A}\\times \\mathbf{B})\\cap (\\mathbf{A}\\times \\mathbf{C})$ \n\n(iii) $\\mathrm{A}\\times (\\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{C})$ \n\n(iv) $(\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B})\\cup (\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{C})$ \n\nSolution (i) By the definition of the intersection of two sets, $(\\mathrm{B}\\cap \\mathrm{C}) = \\{4\\}$ \n\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{A} \\times (\\mathrm{B} \\cap \\mathrm{C}) = \\{(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)\\}$ . \n\n(ii) Now $(\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B}) = \\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4)\\}$ \n\nTherefore, $(\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{B})\\cap (\\mathrm{A}\\times \\mathrm{C}) = \\{(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)\\}$ \n\n(iii) Since, $(\\mathrm{B}\\cup \\mathrm{C}) = \\{3,4,5,6\\}$ we have \n\n(iv) Using the sets $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{C}$ from part (ii) above, we obtain \n\nExample 4 If $\\mathrm{P} = \\{1,2\\}$ , form the set $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{P}$ . \n\nSolution We have, $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{P} = \\{(1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (2,1,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (2,2,2)\\}$ . \n\nExample 5 If $\\mathbf{R}$ is the set of all real numbers, what do the cartesian products $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}$ represent? \n\nSolution The Cartesian product $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}$ represents the set $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : x, y \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}$ which represents the coordinates of all the points in two-dimensional space and the cartesian product $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R}$ represents the set $\\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R} \\times \\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y, z) : x, y, z \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}$ which represents the coordinates of all the points in three-dimensional space. \n\nExample 6 If $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B} = \\{(p, q), (p, r), (m, q), (m, r)\\}$ , find A and B. \n\nSolution $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{set}$ of first elements $= \\{p,m\\}$ $\\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{set}$ of second elements $= \\{q,r\\}$ \n\nEXERCISE 2.1 \n\n(i) $\\mathrm{A} \\times (\\mathrm{B} \\cap \\mathrm{C}) = (\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B}) \\cap (\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{C})$ . (ii) $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{C}$ is a subset of $\\mathrm{B} \\times \\mathrm{D}$ . \n\n10. The Cartesian product $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{A}$ has 9 elements among which are found $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ . Find the set $\\mathrm{A}$ and the remaining elements of $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{A}$ . \n\n2.3 Relations \n\nConsider the two sets $\\mathrm{P} = \\{a,b,c\\}$ and $\\mathrm{Q} = \\{\\mathrm{Ali},\\mathrm{Bhanu},\\mathrm{Binoy},\\mathrm{Chandra},\\mathrm{Divya}\\}$ . \n\nThe cartesian product of $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ has 15 ordered pairs which can be listed as $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q} = \\{(a, \\mathrm{Ali}), (a, \\mathrm{Bhanu}), (a, \\mathrm{Binoy}), \\dots, (c, \\mathrm{Divya})\\}$ . \n\nWe can now obtain a subset of $\\mathrm{P} \\times \\mathrm{Q}$ by introducing a relation $\\mathbf{R}$ between the first element $x$ and the second element $y$ of each ordered pair $(x, y)$ as \n\n$\\mathrm{R} = \\{(x,y)\\colon x$ is the first letter of the name $y,x\\in \\mathrm{P},y\\in \\mathrm{Q}\\}$ \n\nThen $\\mathrm{R} = \\{(a,\\mathrm{Ali}),(b,\\mathrm{Bhanu}),(b,\\mathrm{Binoy}),(c,\\mathrm{Chandra})\\}$ \n\nA visual representation of this relation R (called an arrow diagram) is shown in Fig 2.4. \n\nDefinition 2 A relation $R$ from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ is a subset of the cartesian product $A \\times B$ . The subset is derived by describing a relationship between the first element and the second element of the ordered pairs in $A \\times B$ . The second element is called the image of the first element. \n\nDefinition 3 The set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation $R$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is called the domain of the relation $R$ . \n\nDefinition 4 The set of all second elements in a relation $R$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is called the range of the relation $R$ . The whole set $B$ is called the codomain of the relation $R$ . Note that range $\\subset$ codomain. \n\nRemarks \n\nExample 7 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ . Define a relation $\\mathrm{R}$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{A}$ by \n\nSolution \n\n(i) By the definition of the relation, \n\nThe corresponding arrow diagram is shown in Fig 2.5. \n\n(ii) We can see that the domain $= \\{1,2,3,4,5,\\}$ \n\nSimilarly, the range $= \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and the codomain $= \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ . \n\nExample 8 The Fig 2.6 shows a relation \n\nbetween the sets $\\mathrm{P}$ and $\\mathrm{Q}$ . Write this relation (i) in set-builder form, (ii) in roster form. \n\nWhat is its domain and range? \n\nSolution It is obvious that the relation R is \" $x$ is the square of $y$ \" \n\nThe domain of this relation is $\\{4,9,25\\}$ \n\nThe range of this relation is $\\{-2, 2, -3, 3, -5, 5\\}$ . \n\nNote that the element 1 is not related to any element in set P. \n\nThe set $\\mathrm{Q}$ is the codomain of this relation. \n\nNote The total number of relations that can be defined from a set A to a set B is the number of possible subsets of A × B. If $n(\\mathrm{A}) = p$ and $n(\\mathrm{B}) = q$ , then $n(\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B}) = pq$ and the total number of relations is $2^{pq}$ . \n\nExample 9 Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\mathrm{B} = \\{3, 4\\}$ . Find the number of relations from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nSolution We have, \n\nSince $n$ ( $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B}$ ) = 4, the number of subsets of $\\mathrm{A} \\times \\mathrm{B}$ is $2^4$ . Therefore, the number of relations from $\\mathrm{A}$ into $\\mathrm{B}$ will be $2^4$ . \n\nRemark A relation R from A to A is also stated as a relation on A. \n\nEXERCISE 2.2 \n\n1. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 14\\}$ . Define a relation $\\mathrm{R}$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{A}$ by $\\mathrm{R} = \\{(x, y) : 3x - y = 0 \\text{, where } x, y \\in \\mathrm{A}\\}$ . Write down its domain, codomain and range. \n\n(i) in set-builder form (ii) roster form. What is its domain and range? \n\n5. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}$ . Let $\\mathrm{R}$ be the relation on $\\mathrm{A}$ defined by \n\n$\\{(a,b)\\colon a,b\\in \\mathrm{A},b$ is exactly divisible by $a\\}$ \n\n2.4 Functions \n\nIn this Section, we study a special type of relation called function. It is one of the most important concepts in mathematics. We can, visualise a function as a rule, which produces new elements out of some given elements. There are many terms such as 'map' or 'mapping' used to denote a function. \n\nDefinition 5 A relation $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is said to be a function if every element of set $A$ has one and only one image in set $B$ . \n\nIn other words, a function $f$ is a relation from a non-empty set $A$ to a non-empty set $B$ such that the domain of $f$ is $A$ and no two distinct ordered pairs in $f$ have the same first element. \n\nIf $f$ is a function from A to B and $(a, b) \\in f$ , then $f(a) = b$ , where $b$ is called the image of $a$ under $f$ and $a$ is called the preimage of $b$ under $f$ . \n\nThe function $f$ from $\\mathrm{A}$ to $\\mathrm{B}$ is denoted by $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ . \n\nLooking at the previous examples, we can easily see that the relation in Example 7 is not a function because the element 6 has no image. \n\nAgain, the relation in Example 8 is not a function because the elements in the domain are connected to more than one images. Similarly, the relation in Example 9 is also not a function. (Why?) In the examples given below, we will see many more relations some of which are functions and others are not. \n\nExample 10 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and the relation $\\mathbf{R}$ be defined on $\\mathbf{N}$ such that $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(x, y) : y = 2x, x, y \\in \\mathbf{N}\\}$ . \n\nWhat is the domain, codomain and range of R? Is this relation a function? \n\nSolution The domain of R is the set of natural numbers N. The codomain is also N. The range is the set of even natural numbers. \n\nSince every natural number $n$ has one and only one image, this relation is a function. \n\nExample 11 Examine each of the following relations given below and state in each case, giving reasons whether it is a function or not? \n\nSolution (i) Since 2, 3, 4 are the elements of domain of R having their unique images, this relation R is a function. \n\nDefinition 6 A function which has either R or one of its subsets as its range is called a real valued function. Further, if its domain is also either R or a subset of R, it is called a real function. \n\nExample 12 Let $\\mathbf{N}$ be the set of natural numbers. Define a real valued function \n\n$f\\colon \\mathbf{N}\\to \\mathbf{N}$ by $f(x) = 2x + 1$ . Using this definition, complete the table given below. \n\nSolution The completed table is given by \n\n2.4.1 Some functions and their graphs \n\n(i) Identity function Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be the set of real numbers. Define the real valued function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ by $y = f(x) = x$ for each $x\\in \\mathbf{R}$ . Such a function is called the identity function. Here the domain and range of $f$ are $\\mathbf{R}$ . The graph is a straight line as shown in Fig 2.8. It passes through the origin. \n\n(ii) Constant function Define the function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ by $y = f(x) = c$ , $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ where $c$ is a constant and each $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . Here domain of $f$ is $\\mathbf{R}$ and its range is $\\{c\\}$ . \n\nThe graph is a line parallel to $x$ -axis. For example, if $f(x) = 3$ for each $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ , then its graph will be a line as shown in the Fig 2.9. \n\n(iii) Polynomial function A function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ is said to be polynomial function if for each $x$ in $\\mathbf{R}$ , $y = f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\ldots + a_nx^n$ , where $n$ is a non-negative integer and $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . \n\nThe functions defined by $f(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 2$ , and $g(x) = x^4 + \\sqrt{2} x$ are some examples \n\nof polynomial functions, whereas the function $h$ defined by $h(x) = x^{\\frac{2}{3}} + 2x$ is not a polynomial function. (Why?) \n\nExample 13 Define the function $f: \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ by $y = f(x) = x^2$ , $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . Complete the Table given below by using this definition. What is the domain and range of this function? \n\nDraw the graph of $f$ . \n\nSolution The completed Table is given below: \n\nDomain of $f = \\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}$ . Range of $f = \\{x^2 : x \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}$ . The graph of $f$ is given by Fig 2.10 \n\nExample 14 Draw the graph of the function $f: \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ defined by $f(x) = x^3$ , $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ . \n\nSolution We have \n\n$f(0) = 0,f(1) = 1,f(-1) = -1,f(2) = 8,f(-2) = -8,f(3) = 27;f(-3) = -27$ ,etc. \n\nTherefore, $f = \\{(x_{\\gamma}x^{3})\\colon x\\in \\mathbf{R}\\}$ \n\nThe graph of $f$ is given in Fig 2.11. \n\n(iv) Rational functions are functions of the type $\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ , where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomial functions of $x$ defined in a domain, where $g(x) \\neq 0$ . \n\nExample 15 Define the real valued function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R} - \\{0\\} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$ , $x \\in \\mathbf{R} - \\{0\\}$ . Complete the Table given below using this definition. What is the domain and range of this function? \n\nSolution The completed Table is given by \n\nThe domain is all real numbers except 0 and its range is also all real numbers except 0. The graph of $f$ is given in Fig 2.12. \n\n(v) The Modulus function The function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ defined by $f(x) = |x|$ for each $x\\in \\mathbf{R}$ is called modulus function. For each non-negative value of $x$ , $f(x)$ is equal to $x$ . But for negative values of $x$ , the value of $f(x)$ is the negative of the value of $x$ , i.e., \n\nThe graph of the modulus function is given in Fig 2.13. \n\n(vi) Signum function The function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ defined by \n\nis called the signum function. The domain of the signum function is $\\mathbf{R}$ and the range is the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ . The graph of the signum function is given by the Fig 2.14. \n\n(vii) Greatest integer function The function $f\\colon \\mathbf{R}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ defined by $f(x) = [x],x\\in \\mathbf{R}$ assumes the value of the greatest integer, less than or equal to $x$ . Such a function is called the greatest integer function. \n\nFrom the definition of $[x]$ , we can see that \n\nso on. \n\nThe graph of the function is shown in Fig 2.15. \n\n2.4.2 Algebra of real functions In this Section, we shall learn how to add two real functions, subtract a real function from another, multiply a real function by a scalar (here by a scalar we mean a real number), multiply two real functions and divide one real function by another. \n\n(i) Addition of two real functions Let $f\\colon \\mathrm{X}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ and $g\\colon \\mathrm{X}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ be any two real functions, where $\\mathrm{X}\\subset \\mathbf{R}$ . Then, we define $(f + g)\\colon \\mathrm{X}\\to \\mathbf{R}$ by \n\nThis is also called pointwise multiplication. \n\n(v) Quotient of two real functions Let $f$ and $g$ be two real functions defined from $\\mathbf{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}$ , where $\\mathbf{X} \\subset \\mathbf{R}$ . The quotient of $f$ by $g$ denoted by $\\frac{f}{g}$ is a function defined by, $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ , provided $g(x) \\neq 0, x \\in \\mathbf{X}$ \n\nExample 16 Let $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = 2x + 1$ be two real functions. Find \n\nSolution We have, \n\nExample 17 Let $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ and $g(x) = x$ be two functions defined over the set of non-negative real numbers. Find $(f + g)(x), (f - g)(x), (fg)(x)$ and $\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)(x)$ . \n\nSolution We have \n\nEXERCISE 2.3 \n\n1. Which of the following relations are functions? Give reasons. If it is a function, determine its domain and range. \n\n2. Find the domain and range of the following real functions: \n\n(i) $f(x) = -|x|$ \n\n(ii) $f(x) = \\sqrt{9 - x^2}$ \n\nFind (i) $t(0)$ (ii) $t(28)$ (iii) $t(-10)$ (iv) The value of $C$ , when $t(C) = 212$ . \n\n5. Find the range of each of the following functions. \n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 18 Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be the set of real numbers. \n\nDefine the real function \n\nand sketch the graph of this function. \n\nSolution Here $f(0) = 10, f(1) = 11, f(2) = 12, \\ldots, f(10) = 20,$ etc., and \n\n$f(-1) = 9,f(-2) = 8,\\dots ,f(-10) = 0$ and so on. \n\nTherefore, shape of the graph of the given function assumes the form as shown in Fig 2.16. \n\nRemark The function $f$ defined by $f(x) = mx + c$ , $x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ , is called linear function, where $m$ and $c$ are constants. Above function is an example of a linear function. \n\nExample 19 Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be a relation from $\\mathbf{Q}$ to $\\mathbf{Q}$ defined by $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(a,b) \\colon a,b \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\text{ and } a - b \\in \\mathbf{Z}\\}$ . Show that \n\nSolution (i) Since, $a - a = 0\\in \\mathbf{Z}$ , if follows that $(a,a)\\in \\mathbb{R}$ \n\nExample 20 Let $f = \\{(1,1), (2,3), (0, -1), (-1, -3)\\}$ be a linear function from $\\mathbf{Z}$ into $\\mathbf{Z}$ . Find $f(x)$ . \n\nSolution Since $f$ is a linear function, $f(x) = mx + c$ . Also, since $(1, 1), (0, -1) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ , $f(1) = m + c = 1$ and $f(0) = c = -1$ . This gives $m = 2$ and $f(x) = 2x - 1$ . \n\nExample 21 Find the domain of the function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 3x + 5}{x^2 - 5x + 4}$ . \n\nSolution Since $x^2 - 5x + 4 = (x - 4)(x - 1)$ , the function $f$ is defined for all real numbers except at $x = 4$ and $x = 1$ . Hence the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbf{R} - \\{1, 4\\}$ . \n\nExample 22 The function $f$ is defined by \n\nDraw the graph of $f(x)$ . \n\nSolution Here, $f(x) = 1 - x, x < 0$ , this gives \n\nand $f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4$ \n\nThus, the graph of $f$ is as shown in Fig 2.17. \n\nMiscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 2 \n\n1. The relation $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 3 \\\\ 3x, & 3 \\leq x \\leq 10 \\end{cases}$ \n\nThe relation $g$ is defined by $g(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 2 \\\\ 3x, & 2 \\leq x \\leq 10 \\end{cases}$ \n\nShow that $f$ is a function and $g$ is not a function. \n\n2.

Find the domain and the range of the real function $f$ defined by $f(x) = \\sqrt{(x - 1)}$ . \n\n5. Find the domain and the range of the real function $f$ defined by $f(x) = |x - 1|$ . \n\n6.

Let $f, g: \\mathbf{R} \\to \\mathbf{R}$ be defined, respectively by $f(x) = x + 1$ , $g(x) = 2x - 3$ . Find $f + g, f - g$ and $\\frac{f}{g}$ . \n\n8.

Let $\\mathbf{R}$ be a relation from $\\mathbf{N}$ to $\\mathbf{N}$ defined by $\\mathbf{R} = \\{(a, b) : a, b \\in \\mathbf{N} \\text{ and } a = b^2\\}$ . Are the following true? \n\nJustify your answer in each case. \n\n10. Let $\\mathrm{A} = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ , $\\mathrm{B} = \\{1,5,9,11,15,16\\}$ and $f = \\{(1,5), (2,9), (3,1), (4,5), (2,11)\\}$ . Are the following true? \n\n(i) $f$ is a relation from A to B (ii) $f$ is a function from A to B. \n\nJustify your answer in each case. \n\nSummary \n\nIn this Chapter, we studied about relations and functions. The main features of this Chapter are as follows: \n\nWe write $f \\colon \\mathrm{A} \\to \\mathrm{B}$ , where $f(x) = y$ . \n\nA is the domain and B is the codomain of $f$ \n\n$(kf)(x) = k(f(x)), x \\in \\mathrm{X},$ where $k$ is a real number. \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe word FUNCTION first appears in a Latin manuscript \"Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de fuctionibus\" written by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716) in 1673; Leibnitz used the word in the non-analytical sense. He considered a function in terms of \"mathematical job\" – the \"employee\" being just a curve. \n\nOn July 5, 1698, Johan Bernoulli, in a letter to Leibnitz, for the first time deliberately assigned a specialised use of the term function in the analytical sense. At the end of that month, Leibnitz replied showing his approval. \n\nFunction is found in English in 1779 in Chambers' Cyclopaedia: \"The term function is used in algebra, for an analytical expression any way compounded of a variable quantity, and of numbers, or constant quantities\".",

    "content": "TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS \n\nA mathematician knows how to solve a problem, he can not solve it. - MILNE \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nThe word 'trigonometry' is derived from the Greek words 'trigon' and 'metron' and it means 'measuring the sides of a triangle'. The subject was originally developed to solve geometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by sea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new lands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is used in many areas such as the science of seismology, designing electric circuits, describing the state of an atom, predicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a musical tone and in many other areas. \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric ratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right \n\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of trigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this Chapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions and study their properties. \n\n3.2 Angles \n\nAngle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is \n\ncalled the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the terminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex. If the direction of rotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation \n\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1). \n\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of rotation performed to get the terminal side from the initial side. There are several units for measuring angles. The definition of an angle \n\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as indicated in Fig 3.2. \n\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly spinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe two other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz. degree measure and radian measure. \n\n3.2.1 Degree measure If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is $\\left(\\frac{1}{360}\\right)^{\\mathrm{th}}$ of a revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree, written as $1^{\\circ}$ . A degree is divided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds. One sixtieth of a degree is called a minute, written as $1'$ , and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second, written as $1''$ . Thus, $1^{\\circ} = 60'$ , $1' = 60''$ \n\nSome of the angles whose measures are $360^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ}, 420^{\\circ}, -30^{\\circ}, -420^{\\circ}$ are shown in Fig 3.3. \n\n3.2.2 Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called the radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a unit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig 3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the angles whose measures are 1 radian, $-1$ radian, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian and $-1\\frac{1}{2}$ radian. \n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is $2\\pi$ . Thus, one complete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian. \n\nMore generally, in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ will subtend an angle of 1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre. Since in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $r$ subtends an angle whose measure is 1 radian, an arc of length $l$ will subtend an angle whose measure is $\\frac{l}{r}$ radian. Thus, if in a circle of radius $r$ , an arc of length $l$ subtends an angle $\\theta$ radian at the centre, we have $\\theta = \\frac{l}{r}$ or $l = r\\theta$ . \n\n3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers Consider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point on the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle. Then the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian measure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the centre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is tangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the real number zero, AP represents positive real number and AQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we rope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the circle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real number will correspond to a radian measure and conversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can be considered as one and the same. \n\n3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre an angle whose radian measure is $2\\pi$ and its degree measure is $360^{\\circ}$ , it follows that \n\nThe above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree measure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value of $\\pi$ as $\\frac{22}{7}$ , we have \n\nAlso $1^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ radian $= 0.01746$ radian approximately. \n\nThe relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles are given in the following table: \n\nNotational Convention \n\nSince angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention that whenever we write angle $\\theta^{\\circ}$ , we mean the angle whose degree measure is $\\theta$ and whenever we write angle $\\beta$ , we mean the angle whose radian measure is $\\beta$ . \n\nNote that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word 'radian' is frequently omitted. Thus, $\\pi = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 45^{\\circ}$ are written with the understanding that $\\pi$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ are radian measures. Thus, we can say that \n\nRadian measure $= \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\times$ Degree measure \n\nDegree measure $= \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\times$ Radian measure \n\nExample 1 Convert $40^{\\circ}20^{\\prime}$ into radian measure. \n\nSolution We know that $180^{\\circ} = \\pi$ radian. \n\nHence $40^{\\circ}20^{\\prime} = 40\\frac{1}{3}$ degree $= \\frac{\\pi}{180}\\times \\frac{121}{3}$ radian $= \\frac{121\\pi}{540}$ radian. \n\nTherefore $40^{\\circ}20^{\\prime} = \\frac{121\\pi}{540}$ radian. \n\nExample 2 Convert 6 radians into degree measure. \n\nSolution We know that $\\pi$ radian $= 180^{\\circ}$ \n\nHence $6 \\text{ radians} = \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\times 6 \\text{ degree} = \\frac{1080 \\times 7}{22} \\text{ degree}$ \n\nHence 6 radians $= 343^{\\circ}38^{\\prime}11^{\\prime \\prime}$ approximately. \n\nExample 3 Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of $60^{\\circ}$ intercepts an arc of length $37.4\\mathrm{cm}$ (use $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$ ). \n\nSolution Here $l = 37.4$ cm and $\\theta = 60^{\\circ} = \\frac{60\\pi}{180}$ radian = $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ \n\nHence, by $r = \\frac{l}{\\theta}$ , we have \n\nExample 4 The minute hand of a watch is $1.5\\mathrm{cm}$ long. How far does its tip move in 40 minutes? (Use $\\pi = 3.14$ ). \n\nSolution In 60 minutes, the minute hand of a watch completes one revolution. Therefore, in 40 minutes, the minute hand turns through $\\frac{2}{3}$ of a revolution. Therefore, $\\theta = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 360^{\\circ}$ or $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ radian. Hence, the required distance travelled is given by \n\nExample 5 If the arcs of the same lengths in two circles subtend angles $65^{\\circ}$ and $110^{\\circ}$ at the centre, find the ratio of their radii. \n\nSolution Let $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ be the radii of the two circles. Given that \n\nand $\\theta_{2} = 110^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\times 110 = \\frac{22\\pi}{36}$ radian \n\nLet $l$ be the length of each of the arc. Then $l = r_{1}\\theta_{1} = r_{2}\\theta_{2}$ , which gives \n\nHence $r_1:r_2 = 22:13.$ \n\nEXERCISE 3.1 \n\n1.

We will now extend the definition of trigonometric ratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions. \n\nConsider a unit circle with centre at origin of the coordinate axes. Let $\\mathrm{P}(a,b)$ be any point on the circle with angle $\\mathrm{AOP} = x$ radian, i.e., length of arc $\\mathrm{AP} = x$ (Fig 3.6). \n\nWe define $\\cos x = a$ and $\\sin x = b$ Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{OMP}$ is a right triangle, we have \n\n$\\mathrm{OM}^2 +\\mathrm{MP}^2 = \\mathrm{OP}^2$ or $a^2 +b^2 = 1$ Thus, for every point on the unit circle, we have \n\nSince one complete revolution subtends an angle of $2\\pi$ radian at the centre of the circle, $\\angle \\mathrm{AOB} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ \n\n$\\angle \\mathrm{AOC} = \\pi$ and $\\angle \\mathrm{AOD} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ . All angles which are integral multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ are called quadrantal angles. The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively, $(1,0)$ , $(0,1)$ , $(-1,0)$ and $(0, -1)$ . Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have \n\nNow, if we take one complete revolution from the point $\\mathrm{P}$ , we again come back to same point $\\mathrm{P}$ . Thus, we also observe that if $x$ increases (or decreases) by any integral multiple of $2\\pi$ , the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus, \n\nFurther, $\\sin x = 0$ , if $x = 0, \\pm \\pi, \\pm 2\\pi, \\pm 3\\pi, \\ldots$ , i.e., when $x$ is an integral multiple of $\\pi$ and $\\cos x = 0$ , if $x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{3\\pi}{2}, \\pm \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\ldots$ i.e., $\\cos x$ vanishes when $x$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ . Thus \n\n$\\sin x = 0$ implies $x = n\\pi$ , where $n$ is any integer \n\nWe now define other trigonometric functions in terms of sine and cosine functions: \n\nWe have shown that for all real $x$ , $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ \n\nIt follows that \n\nIn earlier classes, we have discussed the values of trigonometric ratios for $0^{\\circ}$ , $30^{\\circ}$ , $45^{\\circ}$ , $60^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$ . The values of trigonometric functions for these angles are same as that of trigonometric ratios studied in earlier classes. Thus, we have the following table: \n\nThe values of cosec $x$ , see $x$ and cot $x$ are the reciprocal of the values of $\\sin x$ , $\\cos x$ and $\\tan x$ , respectively. \n\n3.3.1 Sign of trigonometric functions Let $\\mathrm{P}(a,b)$ be a point on the unit circle with centre at the origin such that $\\angle \\mathrm{AOP} = x$ . If $\\angle \\mathrm{AOQ} = -x$ , then the coordinates of the point $\\mathrm{Q}$ will be $(a, -b)$ (Fig 3.7). Therefore \n\n$\\cos (-x) = \\cos x$ and $\\sin (-x) = -\\sin x$ \n\nSince for every point $\\mathrm{P}(a,b)$ on the unit circle, $-1\\leq a\\leq 1$ and \n\n$-1 \\leq b \\leq 1$ , we have $-1 \\leq \\cos x \\leq 1$ and $-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1$ for all $x$ . We have learnt in previous classes that in the first quadrant $(0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2})$ $a$ and $b$ are both positive, in the second quadrant $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < \\pi\\right)$ $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, in the third quadrant $\\left(\\pi < x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right)$ $a$ and $b$ are both negative and in the fourth quadrant $\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} < x < 2\\pi\\right)$ $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative. Therefore, $\\sin x$ is positive for $0 < x < \\pi$ , and negative for $\\pi < x < 2\\pi$ . Similarly, $\\cos x$ is positive for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , negative for $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < x < \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ and also positive for $\\frac{3\\pi}{2} < x < 2\\pi$ . Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric functions in different quadrants. In fact, we have the following table. \n\n3.3.2 Domain and range of trigonometric functions From the definition of sine and cosine functions, we observe that they are defined for all real numbers. Further, we observe that for each real number $x$ , \n\nThus, domain of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\cos x$ is the set of all real numbers and range is the interval $[-1, 1]$ , i.e., $-1 \\leq y \\leq 1$ . \n\nSince $\\operatorname{cosec} x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x}$ , the domain of $y = \\operatorname{cosec} x$ is the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $x \\neq n\\pi, n \\in \\mathbf{Z}\\}$ and range is the set $\\{y : y \\in \\mathbf{R}, y \\geq 1 \\text{ or } y \\leq -1\\}$ . Similarly, the domain of $y = \\sec x$ is the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $x \\neq (2n + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in \\mathbf{Z}\\}$ and range is the set $\\{y : y \\in \\mathbf{R}, y \\leq -1 \\text{ or } y \\geq 1\\}$ . The domain of $y = \\tan x$ is the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $x \\neq (2n + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}, n \\in \\mathbf{Z}\\}$ and range is the set of all real numbers. The domain of $y = \\cot x$ is the set $\\{x : x \\in \\mathbf{R}$ and $x \\neq n\\pi, n \\in \\mathbf{Z}\\}$ and the range is the set of all real numbers. \n\nWe further observe that in the first quadrant, as $x$ increases from 0 to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , $\\sin x$ increases from 0 to 1, as $x$ increases from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\pi$ , $\\sin x$ decreases from 1 to 0. In the third quadrant, as $x$ increases from $\\pi$ to $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ , $\\sin x$ decreases from 0 to -1 and finally, in the fourth quadrant, $\\sin x$ increases from -1 to 0 as $x$ increases from $\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$ to $2\\pi$ . Similarly, we can discuss the behaviour of other trigonometric functions. In fact, we have the following table: \n\nRemark In the above table, the statement $\\tan x$ increases from 0 to $\\infty$ (infinity) for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ simply means that $\\tan x$ increases as $x$ increases for $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and \n\nassumes arbitrarily large positive values as $x$ approaches to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ . Similarly, to say that $\\operatorname{cosec} x$ decreases from $-1$ to $-\\infty$ (minus infinity) in the fourth quadrant means that $\\operatorname{cosec} x$ decreases for $x \\in \\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, 2\\pi\\right)$ and assumes arbitrarily large negative values as $x$ approaches to $2\\pi$ . The symbols $\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ simply specify certain types of behaviour of functions and variables. \n\nWe have already seen that values of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ repeats after an interval of $2\\pi$ . Hence, values of $\\operatorname{cosec} x$ and $\\sec x$ will also repeat after an interval of $2\\pi$ . We \n\nshall see in the next section that $\\tan (\\pi +x) = \\tan x$ . Hence, values of $\\tan x$ will repeat after an interval of $\\pi$ . Since $\\cot x$ is reciprocal of $\\tan x$ , its values will also repeat after an interval of $\\pi$ . Using this knowledge and behaviour of trigonometric functions, we can sketch the graph of these functions. The graph of these functions are given above: \n\nExample 6 If $\\cos x = -\\frac{3}{5}, x$ lies in the third quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions. \n\nSolution Since $\\cos x = -\\frac{3}{5}$ , we have $\\sec x = -\\frac{5}{3}$ . \n\nNow $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ , i.e., $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x$ \n\nor $\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{16}{25}$ \n\nHence $\\sin x = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$ \n\nSince $x$ lies in third quadrant, $\\sin x$ is negative. Therefore \n\nwhich also gives \n\nFurther, we have \n\nExample 7 If $\\cot x = -\\frac{5}{12}$ , $x$ lies in second quadrant, find the values of other five trigonometric functions. \n\nSolution Since $\\cot x = -\\frac{5}{12}$ , we have $\\tan x = -\\frac{12}{5}$ . \n\nNow $\\sec^2 x = 1 + \\tan^2 x = 1 + \\frac{144}{25} = \\frac{169}{25}$ \n\nHence $\\sec x = \\pm \\frac{13}{5}$ \n\nSince $x$ lies in second quadrant, $\\sec x$ will be negative. Therefore \n\nwhich also gives \n\nFurther, we have \n\nand $\\operatorname{cosec} x = \\frac{1}{\\sin x} = \\frac{13}{12}.$ \n\nExample 8 Find the value of $\\sin \\frac{31\\pi}{3}$ . \n\nSolution We know that values of $\\sin x$ repeats after an interval of $2\\pi$ . Therefore \n\nExample 9 Find the value of $\\cos (-1710^{\\circ})$ \n\nSolution We know that values of $\\cos x$ repeats after an interval of $2\\pi$ or $360^{\\circ}$ . Therefore, $\\cos (-1710^{\\circ}) = \\cos (-1710^{\\circ} + 5 \\times 360^{\\circ})$ \n\nEXERCISE 3.2 \n\nFind the values of other five trigonometric functions in Exercises 1 to 5. \n\nFind the values of the trigonometric functions in Exercises 6 to 10. \n\n6. sin $765^{\\circ}$ \n\n7. cosec $(-1410^{\\circ})$ \n\n8. tan $\\frac{19\\pi}{3}$ \n\n9. $\\sin \\left(-\\frac{11\\pi}{3}\\right)$ \n\n10. $\\cot \\left(-\\frac{15 \\pi}{4}\\right)$ \n\n3.4 Trigonometric Functions of Sum and Difference of Two Angles \n\nIn this Section, we shall derive expressions for trigonometric functions of the sum and difference of two numbers (angles) and related expressions. The basic results in this connection are called trigonometric identities. We have seen that \n\nWe shall now prove some more results: \n\n3. $\\cos (x + y) = \\cos x\\cos y - \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\nConsider the unit circle with centre at the origin. Let $x$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_1$ and $y$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Then $(x + y)$ is the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_2$ . Also let $(-y)$ be the angle $\\mathrm{P}_4\\mathrm{OP}_3$ . Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4$ will have the coordinates $\\mathrm{P}_1(\\cos x, \\sin x), \\mathrm{P}_2[\\cos (x + y), \\sin (x + y)], \\mathrm{P}_3[\\cos (-y), \\sin (-y)]$ and $\\mathrm{P}_4(1, 0)$ (Fig 3.14). \n\nConsider the triangles $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{OP}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{OP}_4$ . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore, $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3$ and $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ are equal. By using distance formula, we get \n\nAlso, $\\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2 = [1 - \\cos (x + y)]^2 + [0 - \\sin (x + y)]^2$ \n\nSince $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4$ , we have $\\mathrm{P}_1\\mathrm{P}_3^2 = \\mathrm{P}_2\\mathrm{P}_4^2$ . \n\nTherefore, $2 - 2$ (cos $x$ cos $y - \\sin x$ sin $y) = 2 - 2$ cos $(x + y)$ \n\nHence $\\cos (x + y) = \\cos x\\cos y - \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\n4. $\\cos (x - y) = \\cos x\\cos y + \\sin x\\sin y$ \n\nReplacing $y$ by $-y$ in identity 3, we get \n\n5. $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\sin x$ \n\nIf we replace $x$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $y$ by $x$ in Identity (4), we get \n\n6. $\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - x\\right) = \\cos x$ \n\nUsing the Identity 5, we have \n\n7. $\\sin (x + y) = \\sin x\\cos y + \\cos x\\sin y$ \n\nWe know that \n\n8. $\\sin (x - y) = \\sin x\\cos y - \\cos x\\sin y$ \n\nIf we replace $y$ by $-y$ , in the Identity 7, we get the result. \n\n9. By taking suitable values of $x$ and $y$ in the identities 3, 4, 7 and 8, we get the following results: \n\nSimilar results for $\\tan x$ , $\\cot x$ , $\\sec x$ and $\\csc x$ can be obtained from the results of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ . \n\n10. If none of the angles $x, y$ and $(x + y)$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , then \n\nSince none of the $x, y$ and $(x + y)$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , it follows that $\\cos x$ , $\\cos y$ and $\\cos (x + y)$ are non-zero. Now \n\nDividing numerator and denominator by $\\cos x\\cos y$ , we have \n\n11. $\\tan (x - y) = \\frac{\\tan x - \\tan y}{1 + \\tan x \\tan y}$ \n\nIf we replace $y$ by $-y$ in Identity 10, we get \n\n12. If none of the angles $x, y$ and $(x + y)$ is a multiple of $\\pi$ , then \n\nSince, none of the $x, y$ and $(x + y)$ is multiple of $\\pi$ , we find that $\\sin x \\sin y$ and $\\sin (x + y)$ are non-zero. Now, \n\nDividing numerator and denominator by $\\sin x\\sin y$ , we have \n\nWe know that \n\nReplacing $y$ by $x$ , we get \n\nAgain, $\\cos 2x = \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x$ \n\nWe have $\\cos 2x = \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x = \\frac{\\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x}$ \n\nDividing numerator and denominator by $\\cos^2 x$ , we get \n\n15. $\\sin 2x = 2\\sin x\\cos x = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1 + \\tan^2x} x\\neq n\\pi +\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ where n is an integer We have \n\nReplacing $y$ by $x$ , we get $\\sin 2x = 2\\sin x\\cos x$ . \n\nAgain $\\sin 2x = \\frac{2\\sin x\\cos x}{\\cos^2x + \\sin^2x}$ \n\nDividing each term by $\\cos^2 x$ , we get \n\n16. $\\tan 2x = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1 - \\tan^2x}$ if $2x\\neq n\\pi +\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ where n is an integer \n\nWe know that \n\nReplacing $y$ by $x$ , we get $\\tan 2x = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1 - \\tan^2x}$ . \n\n17. $\\sin 3x = 3\\sin x - 4\\sin^3 x$ \n\nWe have, \n\n18. $\\cos 3x = 4\\cos^3 x - 3\\cos x$ \n\nWe have, \n\n19. $\\tan 3x = \\frac{3\\tan x - \\tan^3x}{1 - 3\\tan^2x}$ if $3x\\neq n\\pi +\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ where n is an integer \n\nWe have $\\tan 3x = \\tan (2x + x)$ \n\n20.

All this knowledge first went from India to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian approach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world. \n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main contribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of mathematics. \n\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions for angles more than $90^{\\circ}$ . A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa (period) contains a proof for the expansion of $\\sin (A + B)$ . Exact expression for sines or cosines of $18^{\\circ}$ , $36^{\\circ}$ , $54^{\\circ}$ , $72^{\\circ}$ , etc., are given by Bhaskara II. \n\nThe symbols $\\sin^{-1}x$ , $\\cos^{-1}x$ , etc., for arc $\\sin x$ , arc $\\cos x$ , etc., were suggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales (about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He is credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by measuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known height, and comparing the ratios: \n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through the proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance using the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.",

    "content": "COMPLEX NUMBERS AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS \n\nMathematics is the Queen of Sciences and Arithmetic is the Queen of Mathematics. - GAUSS \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied linear equations in one and two variables and quadratic equations in one variable. We have seen that the equation $x^{2} + 1 = 0$ has no real solution as $x^{2} + 1 = 0$ gives $x^{2} = -1$ and square of every real number is non-negative. So, we need to extend the real number system to a larger system so that we can find the solution of the equation $x^{2} = -1$ . In fact, the main objective is to solve the equation $ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$ , where $\\mathrm{D} = b^{2} - 4ac < 0$ , which is not possible in the system of real numbers. \n\n4.2 Complex Numbers \n\nLet us denote $\\sqrt{-1}$ by the symbol $i$ . Then, we have $i^2 = -1$ . This means that $i$ is a solution of the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ . \n\nA number of the form $a + ib$ , where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, is defined to be a complex number. For example, $2 + i3$ , $(-1) + i\\sqrt{3}$ , $4 + i\\left(\\frac{-1}{11}\\right)$ are complex numbers. \n\nFor the complex number $z = a + ib$ , $a$ is called the real part, denoted by $\\operatorname{Re} z$ and $b$ is called the imaginary part denoted by $\\operatorname{Im} z$ of the complex number $z$ . For example, if $z = 2 + i5$ , then $\\operatorname{Re} z = 2$ and $\\operatorname{Im} z = 5$ . \n\nTwo complex numbers $z_{1} = a + ib$ and $z_{2} = c + id$ are equal if $a = c$ and $b = d$ . \n\nExample 1 If $4x + i(3x - y) = 3 + i(-6)$ , where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then find the values of $x$ and $y$ . \n\nSolution We have \n\nEquating the real and the imaginary parts of (1), we get \n\nwhich, on solving simultaneously, give $x = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $y = \\frac{33}{4}$ . \n\n4.3 Algebra of Complex Numbers \n\nIn this Section, we shall develop the algebra of complex numbers. \n\n4.3.1 Addition of two complex numbers Let $z_{1} = a + ib$ and $z_{2} = c + id$ be any two complex numbers. Then, the sum $z_{1} + z_{2}$ is defined as follows: \n\n$z_{1} + z_{2} = (a + c) + i(b + d)$ , which is again a complex number. For example, $(2 + i3) + (-6 + i5) = (2 - 6) + i(3 + 5) = -4 + i8$ \n\nThe addition of complex numbers satisfy the following properties: \n\n4.3.2 Difference of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ , the difference $z_{1} - z_{2}$ is defined as follows: \n\nFor example, $(6 + 3i) - (2 - i) = (6 + 3i) + (-2 + i) = 4 + 4i$ \n\nand \n\n4.3.3 Multiplication of two complex numbers Let $z_{1} = a + ib$ and $z_{2} = c + id$ be any two complex numbers. Then, the product $z_{1}z_{2}$ is defined as follows: \n\nFor example, $(3 + i5)(2 + i6) = (3 \\times 2 - 5 \\times 6) + i(3 \\times 6 + 5 \\times 2) = -24 + i28$ \n\nThe multiplication of complex numbers possesses the following properties, which we state without proofs. \n\n(vi) The distributive law For any three complex numbers $z_{1},z_{2},z_{3}$ \n\n4.3.4 Division of two complex numbers Given any two complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ , where $z_{2} \\neq 0$ , the quotient $\\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}}$ is defined by \n\nFor example, let $z_{1} = 6 + 3i$ and $z_{2} = 2 - i$ \n\nThen $\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\left((6 + 3i)\\times \\frac{1}{2 - i}\\right) = (6 + 3i)\\left(\\frac{2}{2^2 + (-1)^2} +i\\frac{-(-1)}{2^2 + (-1)^2}\\right)$ \n\n4.3.5 Power of $i$ we know that \n\nAlso, we have $i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{i} \\times \\frac{i}{i} = \\frac{i}{-1} = -i, \\quad i^{-2} = \\frac{1}{i^2} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1,$ \n\nIn general, for any integer $k$ , $i^{4k} = 1$ , $i^{4k + 1} = i$ , $i^{4k + 2} = -1$ , $i^{4k + 3} = -i$ \n\n4.3.6 The square roots of a negative real number \n\nNote that $i^2 = -1$ and $(-i)^2 = i^2 = -1$ \n\nTherefore, the square roots of $-1$ are $i, -i$ . However, by the symbol $\\sqrt{-1}$ , we would mean $i$ only. \n\nNow, we can see that $i$ and $-i$ both are the solutions of the equation $x^{2} + 1 = 0$ or $x^{2} = -1$ . \n\nSimilarly $\\left(\\sqrt{3} i\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\sqrt{3}\\right)^{2}i^{2} = 3(-1) = -3$ \n\nTherefore, the square roots of $-3$ are $\\sqrt{3}i$ and $-\\sqrt{3}i$ . \n\nAgain, the symbol $\\sqrt{-3}$ is meant to represent $\\sqrt{3}i$ only, i.e., $\\sqrt{-3} = \\sqrt{3}i$ . \n\nGenerally, if $a$ is a positive real number, $\\sqrt{-a} = \\sqrt{a} \\sqrt{-1} = \\sqrt{a} i$ , \n\nWe already know that $\\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$ for all positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ . This result also holds true when either $a > 0$ , $b < 0$ or $a < 0$ , $b > 0$ . What if $a < 0$ , $b < 0$ ? Let us examine. \n\nNote that \n\n$i^2 = \\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1} = \\sqrt{(-1)(-1)}$ (by assuming $\\sqrt{a}\\times \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$ for all real numbers) $= \\sqrt{1} = 1$ , which is a contradiction to the fact that $i^2 = -1$ \n\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} \\neq \\sqrt{ab}$ if both $a$ and $b$ are negative real numbers. \n\nFurther, if any of $a$ and $b$ is zero, then, clearly, $\\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab} = 0$ . \n\n4.3.7 Identities We prove the following identity \n\n$\\left(z_{1} + z_{2}\\right)^{2} = z_{1}^{2} + z_{2}^{2} + 2z_{1}z_{2}$ , for all complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ . \n\nProof We have, $(z_{1} + z_{2})^{2} = (z_{1} + z_{2})(z_{1} + z_{2}),$ \n\nSimilarly, we can prove the following identities: \n\nIn fact, many other identities which are true for all real numbers, can be proved to be true for all complex numbers. \n\nExample 2 Express the following in the form of $a + bi$ : \n\n(i) $\\left(-5i\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{8} i\\right)$ \n\n(ii) $\\left(-i\\right)\\left(2i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{8} i\\right)^{3}$ \n\nSolution (i) $\\left(-5i\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{8}i\\right) = \\frac{-5}{8}i^{2} = \\frac{-5}{8}(-1) = \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{8} + i0$ \n\n(ii) $\\left(-i\\right)\\left(2i\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{8} i\\right)^{3} = 2\\times \\frac{1}{8\\times 8\\times 8}\\times i^{5} = \\frac{1}{256}\\left(i^{2}\\right)^{2}i = \\frac{1}{256} i.$ \n\nExample 3 Express $(5 - 3i)^{3}$ in the form $a + ib$ . \n\nSolution We have, $(5 - 3i)^{3} = 5^{3} - 3 \\times 5^{2} \\times (3i) + 3 \\times 5(3i)^{2} - (3i)^{3}$ \n\nExample 4 Express $\\left(-\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{-2}\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{3} - i\\right)$ in the form of $a + ib$ \n\nSolution We have, $\\left(-\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{-2}\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{3} - i\\right) = \\left(-\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}i\\right)\\left(2\\sqrt{3} - i\\right)$ \n\n4.4 The Modulus and the Conjugate of a Complex Number \n\nLet $z = a + ib$ be a complex number. Then, the modulus of $z$ , denoted by $|z|$ , is defined to be the non-negative real number $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ , i.e., $|z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and the conjugate of $z$ , denoted as $\\overline{z}$ , is the complex number $a - ib$ , i.e., $\\overline{z} = a - ib$ . \n\nFor example, $\\left| 3 + i \\right| = \\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{10}$ , $\\left| 2 - 5i \\right| = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-5)^2} = \\sqrt{29}$ , \n\nand $\\overline{3 + i} = 3 - i, \\overline{2 - 5i} = 2 + 5i, \\overline{-3i - 5} = 3i - 5$ \n\nObserve that the multiplicative inverse of the non-zero complex number $z$ is given by \n\nor $z\\overline{z} = |z|^2$ \n\nFurthermore, the following results can easily be derived. \n\nFor any two complex numbers $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ , we have \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) $\\left|\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right| = \\frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$ provided $|z_2| \\neq 0$ \n\n(iii) $\\overline{z_1z_2} = \\overline{z_1}\\overline{z_2}$ \n\n(iv) $\\overline{z_1 \\pm z_2} = \\overline{z_1} \\pm \\overline{z_2}$ (v) $\\overline{\\left(\\frac{z_1}{z_2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\overline{z_1}}{\\overline{z_2}}$ provided $z_2 \\neq 0$ . \n\nExample 5 Find the multiplicative inverse of $2 - 3i$ . \n\nSolution Let $z = 2 - 3i$ \n\nThen $\\overline{z} = 2 + 3i$ and $\\left|z\\right|^2 = 2^2 +(-3)^2 = 13$ \n\nTherefore, the multiplicative inverse of $2 - 3i$ is given by \n\nThe above working can be reproduced in the following manner also, \n\nExample 6 Express the following in the form $a + ib$ \n\n(i) $\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}i}{1 - \\sqrt{2}i}$ \n\n(ii) \n\n35 \n\nSolution (i) We have, $\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}i}{1 - \\sqrt{2}i} = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{2}i}{1 - \\sqrt{2}i} \\times \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2}i}{1 + \\sqrt{2}i} = \\frac{5 + 5\\sqrt{2}i + \\sqrt{2}i - 2}{1 - \\left(\\sqrt{2}i\\right)^2}$ \n\n(ii) $i^{-35} = \\frac{1}{i^{35}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(i^2\\right)^{17}i} = \\frac{1}{-i}\\times \\frac{i}{i} = \\frac{i}{-i^2} = i$ \n\nEXERCISE 4.1 \n\nExpress each of the complex number given in the Exercises 1 to 10 in the form $a + ib$ . \n\n1. $(5i)\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}i\\right)$ \n\n2. $i^9 +i^{19}$ \n\n3. $i^{-39}$ \n\n4. $3(7 + i7) + i(7 + i7)$ \n\n5. $(1 - i) - (-1 + i6)$ \n\n6. $\\left(\\frac{1}{5} + i\\frac{2}{5}\\right) - \\left(4 + i\\frac{5}{2}\\right)$ \n\n7. $\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + i\\frac{7}{3}\\right) + \\left(4 + i\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right] - \\left(-\\frac{4}{3} + i\\right)$ \n\n8. $(1 - i)^{4}$ \n\n9. $\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + 3i\\right)^3$ \n\n10. $\\left(-2 - \\frac{1}{3} i\\right)^{3}$ \n\nFind the multiplicative inverse of each of the complex numbers given in the Exercises 11 to 13. \n\n11. $4 - 3i$ \n\n12. $\\sqrt{5} + 3i$ \n\n13. -i \n\n14. Express the following expression in the form of $a + ib$ : \n\n4.5 Argand Plane and Polar Representation \n\nWe already know that corresponding to each ordered pair of real numbers $(x,y)$ , we get a unique point in the XY-plane and vice-versa with reference to a set of mutually perpendicular lines known as the $x$ -axis and the $y$ -axis. The complex number $x + iy$ which corresponds to the ordered pair $(x,y)$ can be represented geometrically as the unique point $\\mathrm{P}(x,y)$ in the XY-plane and vice-versa. \n\nSome complex numbers such as $2 + 4i, -2 + 3i, 0 + 1i, 2 + 0i, -5 - 2i$ and $1 - 2i$ which correspond to the ordered \n\npairs $(2,4),(-2,3),(0,1),(2,0),(-5, - 2)$ , and $(1, - 2)$ , respectively, have been represented geometrically by the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively in the Fig 4.1. \n\nThe plane having a complex number assigned to each of its points is called the complex plane or the Argand plane. \n\nObviously, in the Argand plane, the modulus of the complex number \n\n$x + iy = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is the distance between the point $\\mathrm{P}(x,y)$ and the origin O $(0,0)$ (Fig 4.2). The points on the $x$ -axis correspond to the complex numbers of the form $a + i0$ and the points on the $y$ -axis correspond to the complex numbers of the form \n\n$0 + i b$ . The $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis in the Argand plane are called, respectively, the real axis and the imaginary axis. \n\nThe representation of a complex number $z = x + iy$ and its conjugate $z = x - iy$ in the Argand plane are, respectively, the points $\\mathrm{P}(x, y)$ and $\\mathrm{Q}(x, -y)$ . \n\nGeometrically, the point $(x, -y)$ is the mirror image of the point $(x, y)$ on the real axis (Fig 4.3). \n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 7 Find the conjugate of $\\frac{(3 - 2i)(2 + 3i)}{(1 + 2i)(2 - i)}$ . \n\nSolution We have, $\\frac{(3 - 2i)(2 + 3i)}{(1 + 2i)(2 - i)}$ \n\nTherefore, conjugate of $\\frac{(3 - 2i)(2 + 3i)}{(1 + 2i)(2 - i)}$ is $\\frac{63}{25} + \\frac{16}{25}i$ . \n\nExample 8 If $x + iy = \\frac{a + ib}{a - ib}$ , prove that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ . \n\nSolution We have, \n\nSo that, $x - iy = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 + b^2} - \\frac{2ab}{a^2 + b^2} i$ \n\nTherefore, \n\nMiscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 4 \n\n(i) $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\frac{z_1z_2}{\\overline{z}_1}\\right)$ \n\n(ii) $\\operatorname{Im}\\left(\\frac{1}{z_1\\overline{z}_1}\\right)$ \n\nSummary \n\nFor any non-zero complex number $z = a + ib$ ( $a \\neq 0$ , $b \\neq 0$ ), there exists the complex number $\\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2} + i\\frac{-b}{a^2 + b^2}$ , denoted by $\\frac{1}{z}$ or $z^{-1}$ , called the multiplicative inverse of $z$ such that $(a + ib)\\frac{a}{a^2 + b^2} + i\\frac{-b}{a^2 + b^2} = 1 + i0 = 1$ \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe fact that square root of a negative number does not exist in the real number system was recognised by the Greeks. But the credit goes to the Indian mathematician Mahavira (850) who first stated this difficulty clearly. \"He mentions in his work 'Ganitasara Sangraha' as in the nature of things a negative (quantity) is not a square (quantity)', it has, therefore, no square root\". Bhaskara, another Indian mathematician, also writes in his work Bijaganita, written in 1150. \"There is no square root of a negative quantity, for it is not a square.\" Cardan (1545) considered the problem of solving \n\nHe obtained $x = 5 + \\sqrt{-15}$ and $y = 5 - \\sqrt{-15}$ as the solution of it, which was discarded by him by saying that these numbers are 'useless'. Albert Girard (about 1625) accepted square root of negative numbers and said that this will enable us to get as many roots as the degree of the polynomial equation. Euler was the first to introduce the symbol $i$ for $\\sqrt{-1}$ and W.R. Hamilton (about 1830) regarded the complex number $a + ib$ as an ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$ thus giving it a purely mathematical definition and avoiding use of the so-called 'imaginary numbers'.",

    "content": "LINEAR INEQUALITIES \n\nMathematics is the art of saying many things in many different ways. - MAXWELL \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied equations in one variable and two variables and also solved some statement problems by translating them in the form of equations. Now a natural question arises: 'Is it always possible to translate a statement problem in the form of an equation? For example, the height of all the students in your class is less than $160~\\mathrm{cm}$ . Your classroom can occupy almost 60 tables or chairs or both. Here we get certain statements involving a sign $<$ (less than), $>$ (greater than), $≤$ (less than or equal) and $\\geq$ (greater than or equal) which are known as inequalities. \n\nIn this Chapter, we will study linear inequalities in one and two variables. The study of inequalities is very useful in solving problems in the field of science, mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology, etc. \n\n5.2 Inequalities \n\nLet us consider the following situations: \n\n(i) Ravi goes to market with ₹200 to buy rice, which is available in packets of 1kg. The price of one packet of rice is ₹30. If $x$ denotes the number of packets of rice, which he buys, then the total amount spent by him is ₹30x. Since, he has to buy rice in packets only, he may not be able to spend the entire amount of ₹200. (Why?) Hence \n\nClearly the statement (i) is not an equation as it does not involve the sign of equality. \n\n(ii) Reshma has $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 120 and wants to buy some registers and pens. The cost of one register is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 40 and that of a pen is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 20. In this case, if $x$ denotes the number of registers and $y$ , the number of pens which Reshma buys, then the total amount spent by her is $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}} (40x + 20y)$ and we have \n\nSince in this case the total amount spent may be upto $\\overline{\\mathbf{\\tau}}$ 120. Note that the statement (2) consists of two statements \n\nStatement (3) is not an equation, i.e., it is an inequality while statement (4) is an equation. \n\nDefinition 1 Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbol $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ , $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ , $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ or $\\langle \\langle \\rangle \\rangle$ form an inequality. \n\nStatements such as (1), (2) and (3) above are inequalities. \n\n$3 < 5$ ; $7 > 5$ are the examples of numerical inequalities while \n\n$x < 5; y > 2; x \\geq 3, y \\leq 4$ are some examples of literal inequalities. \n\n$3 < 5 < 7$ (read as 5 is greater than 3 and less than 7), $3 \\leq x < 5$ (read as $x$ is greater than or equal to 3 and less than 5) and $2 < y \\leq 4$ are the examples of double inequalities. \n\nSome more examples of inequalities are: \n\nInequalities (5), (6), (9), (10) and (14) are strict inequalities while inequalities (7), (8), (11), (12), and (13) are slack inequalities. Inequalities from (5) to (8) are linear inequalities in one variable $x$ when $a \\neq 0$ , while inequalities from (9) to (12) are linear inequalities in two variables $x$ and $y$ when $a \\neq 0$ , $b \\neq 0$ . \n\nInequalities (13) and (14) are not linear (in fact, these are quadratic inequalities in one variable $x$ when $a \\neq 0$ ). \n\nIn this Chapter, we shall confine ourselves to the study of linear inequalities in one and two variables only. \n\n5.3 Algebraic Solutions of Linear Inequalities in One Variable and their Graphical Representation \n\nLet us consider the inequality (1) of Section 6.2, viz, $30x < 200$ \n\nNote that here $x$ denotes the number of packets of rice. \n\nObviously, $x$ cannot be a negative integer or a fraction. Left hand side (L.H.S.) of this inequality is $30x$ and right hand side (RHS) is 200. Therefore, we have \n\nFor $x = 0$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ $(0) = 0 < 200$ (R.H.S.), which is true. \n\nFor $x = 1$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (1) $= 30 < 200$ (R.H.S.), which is true. \n\nFor $x = 2$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (2) $= 60 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 3$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (3) $= 90 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 4$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (4) $= 120 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 5$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (5) $= 150 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 6$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (6) $= 180 < 200$ , which is true. \n\nFor $x = 7$ , L.H.S. $= 30$ (7) $= 210 < 200$ , which is false. \n\nIn the above situation, we find that the values of $x$ , which makes the above inequality a true statement, are $0,1,2,3,4,5,6$ . These values of $x$ , which make above inequality a true statement, are called solutions of inequality and the set $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ is called its solution set. \n\nThus, any solution of an inequality in one variable is a value of the variable which makes it a true statement. \n\nWe have found the solutions of the above inequality by trial and error method which is not very efficient. Obviously, this method is time consuming and sometimes not feasible. We must have some better or systematic techniques for solving inequalities. Before that we should go through some more properties of numerical inequalities and follow them as rules while solving the inequalities. \n\nYou will recall that while solving linear equations, we followed the following rules: \n\nRule 1 Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an equation. \n\nRule 2 Both sides of an equation may be multiplied (or divided) by the same non-zero number. \n\nIn the case of solving inequalities, we again follow the same rules except with a difference that in Rule 2, the sign of inequality is reversed (i.e., $\\langle \\langle$ becomes $\\langle \\rangle$ , $\\leq$ becomes $\\geq$ and so on) whenever we multiply (or divide) both sides of an inequality by a negative number. It is evident from the facts that \n\nThus, we state the following rules for solving an inequality: \n\nRule 1 Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from) both sides of an inequality without affecting the sign of inequality. \n\nRule 2 Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided) by the same positive number. But when both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number, then the sign of inequality is reversed. \n\nNow, let us consider some examples. \n\nExample 1 Solve $30x < 200$ when \n\n(i) $x$ is a natural number, \n\n(ii) $x$ is an integer. \n\nSolution We are given $30x < 200$ \n\nor $\\frac{30x}{30} < \\frac{200}{30}$ (Rule 2), i.e., $x < 20 / 3$ . \n\n(i) When $x$ is a natural number, in this case the following values of $x$ make the statement true. \n\nThe solution set of the inequality is $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ . \n\n(ii) When $x$ is an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are \n\nThe solution set of the inequality is $\\{......, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ \n\nExample 2 Solve $5x - 3 < 3x + 1$ when \n\n(i) $x$ is an integer, \n\n(ii) $x$ is a real number. \n\nSolution We have, $5x - 3 < 3x + 1$ \n\nor $5x - 3 + 3 <   3x + 1 + 3$ (Rule 1) \n\nor $5x <   3x + 4$ \n\nor $5x - 3x <   3x + 4 - 3x$ (Rule 1) \n\nor $2x <   4$ \n\nor $x <   2$ （Rule2)\n\n(i) When $x$ is an integer, the solutions of the given inequality are \n\n(ii) When $x$ is a real number, the solutions of the inequality are given by $x < 2$ , i.e., all real numbers $x$ which are less than 2. Therefore, the solution set of the inequality is $x \\in (-\\infty, 2)$ . \n\nWe have considered solutions of inequalities in the set of natural numbers, set of integers and in the set of real numbers. Henceforth, unless stated otherwise, we shall solve the inequalities in this Chapter in the set of real numbers. \n\nExample 3 Solve $4x + 3 < 6x + 7$ . \n\nSolution We have, $4x + 3 < 6x + 7$ \n\nor $4x - 6x <   6x + 4 - 6x$ \n\nor $-2x < 4$ or $x > -2$ \n\ni.e., all the real numbers which are greater than $-2$ , are the solutions of the given inequality. Hence, the solution set is $(-2, \\infty)$ . \n\nExample 4 Solve $\\frac{5 - 2x}{3} \\leq \\frac{x}{6} - 5$ . \n\nSolution We have \n\nor $2(5 - 2x)\\leq x - 30.$ \n\nor $10 - 4x\\leq x - 30$ \n\nor \n\nThus, all real numbers $x$ which are greater than or equal to 8 are the solutions of the given inequality, i.e., $x \\in [8, \\infty)$ . \n\nExample 5 Solve $7x + 3 < 5x + 9$ . Show the graph of the solutions on number line. \n\nSolution We have $7x + 3 < 5x + 9$ or \n\nThe graphical representation of the solutions are given in Fig 5.1. \n\nExample 6 Solve $\\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\geq \\frac{x + 1}{4} - 1$ . Show the graph of the solutions on number line. \n\nSolution We have \n\nor $\\frac{3x - 4}{2} \\geq \\frac{x - 3}{4}$ \n\nor $2(3x - 4)\\geq (x - 3)$ \n\nor $6x - 8\\geq x - 3$ \n\nor $5x\\geq 5$ or $x\\geq 1$ \n\nThe graphical representation of solutions is given in Fig 5.2. \n\nExample 7 The marks obtained by a student of Class XI in first and second terminal examination are 62 and 48, respectively. Find the minimum marks he should get in the annual examination to have an average of at least 60 marks. \n\nSolution Let $x$ be the marks obtained by student in the annual examination. Then \n\nor $110 + x\\geq 180$ \n\nor $x\\geq 70$ \n\nThus, the student must obtain a minimum of 70 marks to get an average of at least 60 marks. \n\nExample 8 Find all pairs of consecutive odd natural numbers, both of which are larger than 10, such that their sum is less than 40. \n\nSolution Let $x$ be the smaller of the two consecutive odd natural numbers, so that the other one is $x + 2$ . Then, we should have \n\n$x > 10$ （20 1\n\nand $x + (x + 2) <   40$ (2) \n\nSolving (2), we get \n\ni.e., $x <   19$ (3) \n\nFrom (1) and (3), we get \n\nSince $x$ is an odd number, $x$ can take the values 11, 13, 15, and 17. So, the required possible pairs will be \n\n(11, 13), (13, 15), (15, 17), (17, 19) \n\nEXERCISE 5.1 \n\n1. Solve $24x < 100$ , when \n\n(i) $x$ is a natural number. \n\n(ii) $x$ is an integer. \n\n2.

The number lock has 4 wheels each labelled with 10 digits from 0 to 9. The lock can be opened if 4 specific digits are arranged in a particular sequence with no repetition. Some how, you have forgotten this specific sequence of digits. You remember only the first digit which is 7. In order to open the lock, how many sequences of 3-digits you may have to check with? To answer this question, you may, immediately, start listing all possible arrangements of 9 remaining digits taken 3 at a time. But, this method will be tedious, because the number of possible sequences may be large. Here, in this Chapter, we shall learn some basic counting techniques which will \n\nenable us to answer this question without actually listing 3-digit arrangements. In fact, these techniques will be useful in determining the number of different ways of arranging and selecting objects without actually listing them. As a first step, we shall examine a principle which is most fundamental to the learning of these techniques. \n\n6.2 Fundamental Principle of Counting \n\nLet us consider the following problem. Mohan has 3 pants and 2 shirts. How many different pairs of a pant and a shirt, can he dress up with? There are 3 ways in which a pant can be chosen, because there are 3 pants available. Similarly, a shirt can be chosen in 2 ways. For every choice of a pant, there are 2 choices of a shirt. Therefore, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ pairs of a pant and a shirt. \n\nLet us name the three pants as $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3$ and the two shirts as $\\mathrm{S}_1, \\mathrm{S}_2$ . Then, these six possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.1. \n\nLet us consider another problem of the same type. \n\nSabnam has 2 school bags, 3 tiffin boxes and 2 water bottles. In how many ways can she carry these items (choosing one each). \n\nA school bag can be chosen in 2 different ways. After a school bag is chosen, a tiffin box can be chosen in 3 different ways. Hence, there are $2 \\times 3 = 6$ pairs of school bag and a tiffin box. For each of these pairs a water bottle can be chosen in 2 different ways. \n\nHence, there are $6 \\times 2 = 12$ different ways in which, Sabnam can carry these items to school. If we name the 2 school bags as $\\mathrm{B}_1, \\mathrm{B}_2$ , the three tiffin boxes as $\\mathrm{T}_1, \\mathrm{T}_2, \\mathrm{T}_3$ and the two water bottles as $\\mathrm{W}_1, \\mathrm{W}_2$ , these possibilities can be illustrated in the Fig. 6.2. \n\nIn fact, the problems of the above types are solved by applying the following principle known as the fundamental principle of counting, or, simply, the multiplication principle, which states that \n\n\"If an event can occur in $m$ different ways, following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, then the total number of occurrence of the events in the given order is $m \\times n$ . \n\nThe above principle can be generalised for any finite number of events. For example, for 3 events, the principle is as follows: \n\n'If an event can occur in $m$ different ways, following which another event can occur in $n$ different ways, following which a third event can occur in $p$ different ways, then the total number of occurrence to 'the events in the given order is $m \\times n \\times p$ .' \n\nIn the first problem, the required number of ways of wearing a pant and a shirt was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: \n\nIn the second problem, the required number of ways was the number of different ways of the occurrence of the following events in succession: \n\nHere, in both the cases, the events in each problem could occur in various possible orders. But, we have to choose any one of the possible orders and count the number of different ways of the occurrence of the events in this chosen order. \n\nExample 1 Find the number of 4 letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word ROSE, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed. \n\nSolution There are as many words as there are ways of filling in 4 vacant places \n\n□□□□by the 4 letters, keeping in mind that the repetition is not allowed. The first place can be filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 letters R,O,S,E. Following which, the second place can be filled in by anyone of the remaining 3 letters in 3 different ways, following which the third place can be filled in 2 different ways; following which, the fourth place can be filled in 1 way. Thus, the number of ways in which the 4 places can be filled, by the multiplication principle, is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ . Hence, the required number of words is 24. \n\nNote If the repetition of the letters was allowed, how many words can be formed? \n\nOne can easily understand that each of the 4 vacant places can be filled in succession in 4 different ways. Hence, the required number of words $= 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 256$ . \n\nExample 2 Given 4 flags of different colours, how many different signals can be generated, if a signal requires the use of 2 flags one below the other? \n\nSolution There will be as many signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places \n\nin succession by the 4 flags of different colours. The upper vacant place can \n\nbe filled in 4 different ways by anyone of the 4 flags; following which, the lower vacant place can be filled in 3 different ways by anyone of the remaining 3 different flags. \n\nHence, by the multiplication principle, the required number of signals $= 4 \\times 3 = 12$ . \n\nExample 3 How many 2 digit even numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 if the digits can be repeated? \n\nSolution There will be as many ways as there are ways of filling 2 vacant places \n\nin succession by the five given digits. Here, in this case, we start filling in unit's \n\nplace, because the options for this place are 2 and 4 only and this can be done in 2 ways; following which the ten's place can be filled by any of the 5 digits in 5 different ways as the digits can be repeated. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the required number of two digits even numbers is $2 \\times 5$ , i.e., 10. \n\nExample 4 Find the number of different signals that can be generated by arranging at least 2 flags in order (one below the other) on a vertical staff, if five different flags are available. \n\nSolution A signal can consist of either 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags or 5 flags. Now, let us count the possible number of signals consisting of 2 flags, 3 flags, 4 flags and 5 flags separately and then add the respective numbers. \n\nThere will be as many 2 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 2 vacant places \n\nin succession by the 5 flags available. By Multiplication rule, the number of ways is $5 \\times 4 = 20$ . \n\nSimilarly, there will be as many 3 flag signals as there are ways of filling in 3 \n\nvacant places in succession by the 5 flags. \n\nThe number of ways is $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60$ . \n\nContinuing the same way, we find that \n\nThe number of 4 flag signals $= 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 120$ \n\nand the number of 5 flag signals $= 5\\times 4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1 = 120$ \n\nTherefore, the required no of signals $= 20 + 60 + 120 + 120 = 320$ \n\nEXERCISE 6.1 \n\n1. How many 3-digit numbers can be formed from the digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 assuming that \n\n6.3 Permutations \n\nIn Example 1 of the previous Section, we are actually counting the different possible arrangements of the letters such as ROSE, REOS, ..., etc. Here, in this list, each arrangement is different from other. In other words, the order of writing the letters is important. Each arrangement is called a permutation of 4 different letters taken all at a time. Now, if we have to determine the number of 3-letter words, with or without meaning, which can be formed out of the letters of the word NUMBER, where the repetition of the letters is not allowed, we need to count the arrangements NUM, NMU, MUN, NUB, ..., etc. Here, we are counting the permutations of 6 different letters taken 3 at a time. The required number of words $= 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 120$ (by using multiplication principle). \n\nIf the repetition of the letters was allowed, the required number of words would be $6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 216$ . \n\nDefinition 1 A permutation is an arrangement in a definite order of a number of objects taken some or all at a time. \n\nIn the following sub-section, we shall obtain the formula needed to answer these questions immediately. \n\n6.3.1 Permutations when all the objects are distinct \n\nTheorem 1 The number of permutations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time, where $0 < r \\leq n$ and the objects do not repeat is $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\ldots (n - r + 1)$ which is denoted by ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ . \n\nProof There will be as many permutations as there are ways of filling in $r$ vacant \n\nplaces $\\square$ $\\square$ $\\square$ .by \n\nthe $n$ objects. The first place can be filled in $n$ ways; following which, the second place can be filled in $(n - 1)$ ways, following which the third place can be filled in $(n - 2)$ ways,..., the $r$ th place can be filled in $(n - (r - 1))$ ways. Therefore, the number of ways of filling in $r$ vacant places in succession is $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\ldots (n - (r - 1))$ or $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\ldots (n - r + 1)$ \n\nThis expression for ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ is cumbersome and we need a notation which will help to reduce the size of this expression. The symbol $n!$ (read as factorial $n$ or $n$ factorial) comes to our rescue. In the following text we will learn what actually $n!$ means. \n\n6.3.2 Factorial notation The notation $n!$ represents the product of first $n$ natural numbers, i.e., the product $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\ldots \\times (n - 1) \\times n$ is denoted as $n!$ . We read this symbol as ' $n$ factorial'. Thus, $1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\ldots \\times (n - 1) \\times n = n!$ \n\nWe define $0! = 1$ \n\nWe can write $5! = 5 \\times 4! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2!$ \n\nClearly, for a natural number $n$ \n\nand so on. \n\nExample 5 Evaluate (i) 5! (ii) 7! (iii) $7! - 5!$ \n\nSolution (i) $5! = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 120$ \n\n(ii) $7! = 1\\times 2\\times 3\\times 4\\times 5\\times 6\\times 7 = 5040$ \n\nand (iii) $7! - 5! = 5040 - 120 = 4920.$ \n\nExample 6 Compute (i) $\\frac{7!}{5!}$ (ii) $\\frac{12!}{(10!)(2!)}$ \n\nSolution (i) We have $\\frac{7!}{5!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5!}{5!} = 7 \\times 6 = 42$ \n\nand (ii) $\\frac{12!}{(10!)(2!)} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times (10!)}{(10!) \\times (2)} = 6 \\times 11 = 66.$ \n\nExample 7 Evaluate $\\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$ , when $n = 5$ , $r = 2$ . \n\nSolution We have to evaluate $\\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!}$ (since $n = 5, r = 2$ ) \n\nWe have $\\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!\\times 3!} = \\frac{5\\times 4}{2} = 10.$ \n\nExample 8 If $\\frac{1}{8!} + \\frac{1}{9!} = \\frac{x}{10!}$ , find $x$ . \n\nSolution We have $\\frac{1}{8!} + \\frac{1}{9 \\times 8!} = \\frac{x}{10 \\times 9 \\times 8!}$ \n\nTherefore $1 + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{x}{10 \\times 9}$ or $\\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{x}{10 \\times 9}$ \n\nSo $x = 100.$ \n\nEXERCISE 6.2 \n\n1. Evaluate \n\n(i) 8! \n\n(ii) $4! - 3!$ \n\n2. Is $3! + 4! = 7!$ ? \n\n3. Compute $\\frac{8!}{6! \\times 2!}$ \n\n4. If $\\frac{1}{6!} + \\frac{1}{7!} = \\frac{x}{8!}$ , find $x$ \n\n5. Evaluate $\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$ , when \n\n(i) $n = 6, r = 2$ \n\n(ii) $n = 9, r = 5$ . \n\n6.3.3 Derivation of the formula for \"P \n\nLet us now go back to the stage where we had determined the following formula: \n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by $(n - r)(n - r - 1)\\ldots 3\\times 2\\times 1$ , we get \n\nThus \n\nThis is a much more convenient expression for ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ than the previous one. \n\nIn particular, when $r = n$ , $n^{\\mathrm{P}_n} = \\frac{n!}{0!} = n!$ \n\nCounting permutations is merely counting the number of ways in which some or all objects at a time are rearranged. Arranging no object at all is the same as leaving behind all the objects and we know that there is only one way of doing so. Thus, we can have \n\nTherefore, the formula (1) is applicable for $r = 0$ also. \n\nThus \n\nTheorem 2 The number of permutations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time, where repetition is allowed, is $n^r$ . \n\nProof is very similar to that of Theorem 1 and is left for the reader to arrive at. \n\nHere, we are solving some of the problems of the pervious Section using the formula for ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ to illustrate its usefulness. \n\nIn Example 1, the required number of words $= {}^{4}\\mathrm{P}_{4} = 4! = 24$ . Here repetition is not allowed. If repetition is allowed, the required number of words would be $4^{4} = 256$ . \n\nThe number of 3-letter words which can be formed by the letters of the word \n\nNUMBER $= \\mathrm{^6P_3} = \\frac{6!}{3!} = 4\\times 5\\times 6 = 120.$ Here, in this case also, the repetition is not allowed. If the repetition is allowed, the required number of words would be $6^{3} = 216$ \n\nThe number of ways in which a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman can be chosen from amongst a group of 12 persons assuming that one person can not hold more than \n\none position, clearly $^{12}\\mathrm{P}_2 = \\frac{12!}{10!} = 11 \\times 12 = 132$ . \n\n6.3.4 Permutations when all the objects are not distinct objects Suppose we have to find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ROOT. In this case, the letters of the word are not all different. There are 2 Os, which are of the same kind. Let us treat, temporarily, the 2 Os as different, say, $\\mathrm{O}_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$ . The number of permutations of 4-different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 4!. Consider one of these permutations say, $\\mathrm{RO}_1\\mathrm{O}_2\\mathrm{T}$ . Corresponding to this permutation, we have 2! permutations $\\mathrm{RO}_1\\mathrm{O}_2\\mathrm{T}$ and $\\mathrm{RO}_2\\mathrm{O}_1\\mathrm{T}$ which will be exactly the same permutation if $\\mathrm{O}_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$ are not treated as different, i.e., if $\\mathrm{O}_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$ are the same O at both places. \n\nTherefore, the required number of permutations $= \\frac{4!}{2!} = 3 \\times 4 = 12$ . \n\nPermutations when $\\mathrm{O}_1, \\mathrm{O}_2$ are different. \n\nPermutations when $\\mathrm{O}_1, \\mathrm{O}_2$ are the same O. \n\nLet us now find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word INSTITUTE. In this case there are 9 letters, in which I appears 2 times and T appears 3 times. \n\nTemporarily, let us treat these letters different and name them as $\\mathrm{I}_1, \\mathrm{I}_2, \\mathrm{T}_1, \\mathrm{T}_2, \\mathrm{T}_3$ . The number of permutations of 9 different letters, in this case, taken all at a time is 9!. Consider one such permutation, say, $\\mathrm{I}_1 \\mathrm{NT}_1 \\mathrm{SI}_2 \\mathrm{T}_2 \\mathrm{U} \\mathrm{E} \\mathrm{T}_3$ . Here if $\\mathrm{I}_1, \\mathrm{I}_2$ are not same \n\nand $\\mathrm{T}_{1}, \\mathrm{T}_{2}, \\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are not same, then $\\mathrm{I}_{1}, \\mathrm{I}_{2}$ can be arranged in 2! ways and $\\mathrm{T}_{1}, \\mathrm{T}_{2}, \\mathrm{T}_{3}$ can be arranged in 3! ways. Therefore, $2! \\times 3!$ permutations will be just the same permutation corresponding to this chosen permutation $\\mathrm{I}_{1} \\mathrm{NT}_{1} \\mathrm{SI}_{2} \\mathrm{T}_{2} \\mathrm{UET}_{3}$ . Hence, total number of different permutations will be $\\frac{9!}{2!3!}$ \n\nWe can state (without proof) the following theorems: \n\nTheorem 3 The number of permutations of $n$ objects, where $p$ objects are of the same kind and rest are all different $= \\frac{n!}{p!}$ . \n\nIn fact, we have a more general theorem. \n\nTheorem 4 The number of permutations of $n$ objects, where $p_1$ objects are of one kind, $p_2$ are of second kind, ..., $p_k$ are of $k^{\\text{th}}$ kind and the rest, if any, are of different kind is $\\frac{n!}{p_1! p_2! \\cdots p_k!}$ . \n\nExample 9 Find the number of permutations of the letters of the word ALLAHABAD. \n\nSolution Here, there are 9 objects (letters) of which there are 4A's, 2 L's and rest are all different. \n\nTherefore, the required number of arrangements $= \\frac{9!}{4!2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 6 \\times 7 \\times 8 \\times 9}{2} = 7560$ \n\nExample 10 How many 4-digit numbers can be formed by using the digits 1 to 9 if repetition of digits is not allowed? \n\nSolution Here order matters for example 1234 and 1324 are two different numbers. Therefore, there will be as many 4 digit numbers as there are permutations of 9 different digits taken 4 at a time. \n\nTherefore, the required 4 digit numbers $= {}^{9}\\mathrm{P}_{4} = \\frac{9!}{(9 - 4)!} = \\frac{9!}{5!} = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 3024$ . \n\nExample 11 How many numbers lying between 100 and 1000 can be formed with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if the repetition of the digits is not allowed? \n\nSolution Every number between 100 and 1000 is a 3-digit number. We, first, have to \n\ncount the permutations of 6 digits taken 3 at a time. This number would be $^6\\mathrm{P}_3$ . But, these permutations will include those also where 0 is at the 100's place. For example, 092, 042, . . ., etc are such numbers which are actually 2-digit numbers and hence the number of such numbers has to be subtracted from $^6\\mathrm{P}_3$ to get the required number. To get the number of such numbers, we fix 0 at the 100's place and rearrange the remaining 5 digits taking 2 at a time. This number is $^5\\mathrm{P}_2$ . So \n\nThe required number $= {}^{6}\\mathrm{P}_{3} - {}^{5}\\mathrm{P}_{2} = \\frac{6!}{3!} -\\frac{5!}{3!}$ \n\nExample 12 Find the value of $n$ such that \n\n(i) ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_5 = 42{}^n\\mathrm{P}_3, n > 4$ \n\n(ii) $\\frac{{}^n\\mathrm{P}_4}{{}^{n - 1}\\mathrm{P}_4} = \\frac{5}{3},n > 4$ \n\nSolution (i) Given that \n\nor $n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4) = 42n(n - 1)(n - 2)$ \n\nSince $n > 4$ so $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\\neq 0$ \n\nTherefore, by dividing both sides by $n(n - 1)(n - 2)$ , we get \n\nor $n^2 - 7n - 30 = 0$ \n\nor $n^2 -10n + 3n - 30$ \n\nor $(n - 10)(n + 3) = 0$ \n\nor $n - 10 = 0$ or $n + 3 = 0$ \n\nor $n = 10$ or $n = -3$ \n\nAs $n$ cannot be negative, so $n = 10$ . \n\n(ii) Given that $\\frac{{}^n\\mathrm{P}_4}{{}^{n - 1}\\mathrm{P}_4} = \\frac{5}{3}$ \n\nTherefore $3n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) = 5(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)(n - 4)$ \n\nor $3n = 5(n - 4)$ [as $(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3)\\neq 0,n > 4]$ \n\nor $n = 10$ \n\nExample 13 Find $r$ , if $5^{4} \\mathrm{P}_{r} = 6^{5} \\mathrm{P}_{r-1}$ . \n\nSolution We have $5^{4} \\mathrm{P}_{r} = 6^{5} \\mathrm{P}_{r-1}$ \n\nExample 14 Find the number of different 8-letter arrangements that can be made from the letters of the word DAUGHTER so that \n\n(i) all vowels occur together \n\n(ii) all vowels do not occur together. \n\nSolution (i) There are 8 different letters in the word DAUGHTER, in which there are 3 vowels, namely, A, U and E. Since the vowels have to occur together, we can for the time being, assume them as a single object (AUE). This single object together with 5 remaining letters (objects) will be counted as 6 objects. Then we count permutations of these 6 objects taken all at a time. This number would be $^6\\mathrm{P}_6 = 6!$ . Corresponding to each of these permutations, we shall have 3! permutations of the three vowels A, U, E taken all at a time. Hence, by the multiplication principle the required number of permutations $= 6! \\times 3! = 4320$ . \n\n(ii) If we have to count those permutations in which all vowels are never together, we first have to find all possible arrangements of 8 letters taken all at a time, which can be done in 8! ways. Then, we have to subtract from this number, the number of permutations in which the vowels are always together. \n\nTherefore, the required number $8! - 6! \\times 3! = 6! (7 \\times 8 - 6)$ \n\nExample 15 In how many ways can 4 red, 3 yellow and 2 green discs be arranged in a row if the discs of the same colour are indistinguishable? \n\nSolution Total number of discs are $4 + 3 + 2 = 9$ . Out of 9 discs, 4 are of the first kind \n\n(red), 3 are of the second kind (yellow) and 2 are of the third kind (green). \n\nTherefore, the number of arrangements $\\frac{9!}{4!3!2!} = 1260$ . \n\nExample 16 Find the number of arrangements of the letters of the word INDEPENDENCE. In how many of these arrangements, \n\nSolution There are 12 letters, of which N appears 3 times, E appears 4 times and D appears 2 times and the rest are all different. Therefore \n\nThe required number of arrangements $= \\frac{12!}{3!4!2!} = 1663200$ \n\n(i) Let us fix $\\mathrm{P}$ at the extreme left position, we, then, count the arrangements of the remaining 11 letters. Therefore, the required number of words starting with $\\mathrm{P}$ \n\n(ii) There are 5 vowels in the given word, which are 4 Es and 1 I. Since, they have to always occur together, we treat them as a single object EEEI for the time being. This single object together with 7 remaining objects will account for 8 objects. These 8 objects, in which there are 3Ns and 2 Ds, can be rearranged in 8! 3! 2! ways. Corresponding to each of these arrangements, the 5 vowels E, E, E, E and I can be rearranged in 5! 4! ways. Therefore, by multiplication principle, the required number of arrangements \n\n(iii) The required number of arrangements $=$ the total number of arrangements (without any restriction) - the number of arrangements where all the vowels occur together. \n\n(iv) Let us fix I and P at the extreme ends (I at the left end and P at the right end). We are left with 10 letters. \n\nHence, the required number of arrangements \n\nEXERCISE 6.3 \n\n(i) 4 letters are used at a time, \n\n(ii) all letters are used at a time, \n\n(iii) all letters are used but first letter is a vowel? \n\n(i) words start with P and end with S, \n\n(ii) vowels are all together, \n\n(iii) there are always 4 letters between P and S? \n\n6.4 Combinations \n\nLet us now assume that there is a group of 3 lawn tennis players X, Y, Z. A team consisting of 2 players is to be formed. In how many ways can we do so? Is the team of X and Y different from the team of Y and X? Here, order is not important. In fact, there are only 3 possible ways in which the team could be constructed. \n\nThese are XY, YZ and ZX (Fig 6.3). \n\nHere, each selection is called a combination of 3 different objects taken 2 at a time. In a combination, the order is not important. \n\nNow consider some more illustrations. \n\nTwelve persons meet in a room and each shakes hand with all the others. How do we determine the number of hand shakes. X shaking hands with Y and Y with X will not be two different hand shakes. Here, order is not important. There will be as many hand shakes as there are combinations of 12 different things taken 2 at a time. \n\nSeven points lie on a circle. How many chords can be drawn by joining these points pairwise? There will be as many chords as there are combinations of 7 different things taken 2 at a time. \n\nNow, we obtain the formula for finding the number of combinations of $n$ different objects taken $r$ at a time, denoted by ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . \n\nSuppose we have 4 different objects A, B, C and D. Taking 2 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Here, AB and BA are the same combination as order does not alter the combination. This is why we have not included BA, CA, DA, CB, DB and DC in this list. There are as many as 6 combinations of 4 different objects taken 2 at a time, i.e., $^4\\mathrm{C}_2 = 6$ . \n\nCorresponding to each combination in the list, we can arrive at 2! permutations as 2 objects in each combination can be rearranged in 2! ways. Hence, the number of permutations $= ^{4}\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\times 2!$ . \n\nOn the other hand, the number of permutations of 4 different things taken 2 at a time $= 4\\mathrm{P}_2$ . \n\nTherefore \n\nNow, let us suppose that we have 5 different objects A, B, C, D, E. Taking 3 at a time, if we have to make combinations, these will be ABC, ABD, ABE, BCD, BCE, CDE, ACE, ACD, ADE, BDE. Corresponding to each of these $^5\\mathrm{C}_3$ combinations, there are 3! permutations, because, the three objects in each combination can be \n\nrearranged in 3! ways. Therefore, the total of permutations $= {}^{5}{\\mathrm{C}}_{3} \\times  3!$ \n\nTherefore $^5\\mathbf{P}_3 = ^5\\mathbf{C}_3\\times 3!$ or $\\frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!3!} = ^5 C_3$ \n\nThese examples suggest the following theorem showing relationship between permutation and combination: \n\nTheorem 5 ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ $r!$ $0 < r \\leq n$ \n\nProof Corresponding to each combination of ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ , we have $r!$ permutations, because $r$ objects in every combination can be rearranged in $r!$ ways. \n\nHence, the total number of permutations of $n$ different things taken $r$ at a time is ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r \\times r!$ . On the other hand, it is ${}^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ . Thus \n\nRemarks 1. From above $\\frac{n!}{(n - r)!} = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_r\\times r!$ , i.e., ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$ \n\nIn particular, if $r = n$ , ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_n = \\frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1$ . \n\n4. ${}^n\\mathbf{C}_{n - r} = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!(n - (n - r))!} = \\frac{n!}{(n - r)!r!} = {}^n\\mathbf{C}_r,$ \n\ni.e., selecting $r$ objects out of $n$ objects is same as rejecting $(n - r)$ objects. \n\n5. ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_a = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_b\\Rightarrow a = b$ or $a = n - b$ , i.e., $n = a + b$ \n\nTheorem 6 $^n\\mathbf{C}_r + ^n\\mathbf{C}_{r - 1} = ^{n + 1}\\mathbf{C}_r$ \n\nProof We have ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r + {}^n\\mathrm{C}_{r - 1} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} +\\frac{n!}{(r - 1)!(n - r + 1)!}$ \n\nExample 17 If ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_9 = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_8$ , find ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_{17}$ . \n\nSolution We have ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_9 = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_8$ \n\nor $\\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{n - 8}$ or $n - 8 = 9$ or $n = 17$ \n\nTherefore ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_{17} = {}^{17}\\mathrm{C}_{17} = 1$ . \n\nExample 18 A committee of 3 persons is to be constituted from a group of 2 men and 3 women. In how many ways can this be done? How many of these committees would consist of 1 man and 2 women? \n\nSolution Here, order does not matter. Therefore, we need to count combinations. There will be as many committees as there are combinations of 5 different persons taken 3 at a time. Hence, the required number of ways $= \\sqrt[5]{C_3} = \\frac{5!}{3!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10$ . \n\nNow, 1 man can be selected from 2 men in $^2\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways and 2 women can be selected from 3 women in $^3\\mathrm{C}_2$ ways. Therefore, the required number of committees \n\nExample 19 What is the number of ways of choosing 4 cards from a pack of 52 playing cards? In how many of these \n\nSolution There will be as many ways of choosing 4 cards from 52 cards as there are combinations of 52 different things, taken 4 at a time. Therefore \n\nThe required number of ways $= ^{52}C_4 = \\frac{52!}{4!48!} = \\frac{49\\times 50\\times 51\\times 52}{2\\times 3\\times 4}$ \n\n(i) There are four suits: diamond, club, spade, heart and there are 13 cards of each suit. Therefore, there are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways of choosing 4 diamonds. Similarly, there are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways of choosing 4 clubs, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways of choosing 4 spades and $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways of choosing 4 hearts. Therefore \n\nThe required number of ways $= ^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4 + ^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4 + ^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4 + ^{13}\\mathrm{C}_4.$ \n\n(ii) There are 13 cards in each suit. \n\nTherefore, there are $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of diamond, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of hearts, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of clubs, $^{13}\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways of choosing 1 card from 13 cards of spades. Hence, by multiplication principle, the required number of ways \n\n(iii) There are 12 face cards and 4 are to be selected out of these 12 cards. This can be done in $^{12}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways. Therefore, the required number of ways $= \\frac{12!}{4!8!} = 495$ . \n\n(iv) There are 26 red cards and 26 black cards. Therefore, the required number of ways $= ^{26}\\mathrm{C}_2 \\times ^{26}\\mathrm{C}_2$ \n\n(v) 4 red cards can be selected out of 26 red cards in $^{26}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways. 4 black cards can be selected out of 26 black cards in $^{26}\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways. \n\nTherefore, the required number of ways $= ^{26}\\mathrm{C}_4 + ^{26}\\mathrm{C}_4$ \n\nEXERCISE 6.4 \n\n(i) $^{2n}C_3: ^nC_3 = 12:1$ \n\n(ii) $^{2n}C_3 \\colon {}^n C_3 = 11:1$ \n\nMiscellaneous Examples \n\nExample 20 How many words, with or without meaning, each of 3 vowels and 2 consonants can be formed from the letters of the word INVOLUTE? \n\nSolution In the word INVOLUTE, there are 4 vowels, namely, I,O,E,U and 4 consonants, namely, N, V, L and T. \n\nThe number of ways of selecting 3 vowels out of $4 = {}^{4}\\mathrm{C}_{3} = 4$ \n\nThe number of ways of selecting 2 consonants out of $4 = {}^{4}\\mathrm{C}_{2} = 6$ \n\nTherefore, the number of combinations of 3 vowels and 2 consonants is $4 \\times 6 = 24$ . \n\nNow, each of these 24 combinations has 5 letters which can be arranged among themselves in 5! ways. Therefore, the required number of different words is $24 \\times 5! = 2880$ . \n\nExample 21 A group consists of 4 girls and 7 boys. In how many ways can a team of 5 members be selected if the team has (i) no girl? (ii) at least one boy and one girl? (iii) at least 3 girls? \n\nSolution (i) Since, the team will not include any girl, therefore, only boys are to be selected. 5 boys out of 7 boys can be selected in $^7\\mathrm{C}_5$ ways. Therefore, the required \n\nnumber of ways $= 7C_{5} = \\frac{7!}{5!2!} = \\frac{6\\times 7}{2} = 21$ \n\n(ii) Since, at least one boy and one girl are to be there in every team. Therefore, the team can consist of \n\n(a) 1 boy and 4 girls \n\n(b) 2 boys and 3 girls \n\n(c) 3 boys and 2 girls \n\n(d) 4 boys and 1 girl. \n\n1 boy and 4 girls can be selected in $^7\\mathrm{C}_1 \\times {}^4\\mathrm{C}_4$ ways. \n\n2 boys and 3 girls can be selected in $^7\\mathrm{C}_2 \\times {}^4\\mathrm{C}_3$ ways. \n\n3 boys and 2 girls can be selected in $^7\\mathrm{C}_3 \\times {}^4\\mathrm{C}_2$ ways. \n\n4 boys and 1 girl can be selected in $^7\\mathrm{C}_4 \\times {}^4\\mathrm{C}_1$ ways. \n\nTherefore, the required number of ways \n\n(iii) Since, the team has to consist of at least 3 girls, the team can consist of \n\n(a) 3 girls and 2 boys, or \n\n(b) 4 girls and 1 boy. \n\nNote that the team cannot have all 5 girls, because, the group has only 4 girls. \n\nTherefore, the required number of ways \n\nExample 22 Find the number of words with or without meaning which can be made using all the letters of the word AGAIN. If these words are written as in a dictionary, what will be the $50^{\\text{th}}$ word? \n\nSolution There are 5 letters in the word AGAIN, in which A appears 2 times. Therefore, the required number of words $= \\frac{5!}{2!} = 60$ . \n\nTo get the number of words starting with A, we fix the letter A at the extreme left position, we then rearrange the remaining 4 letters taken all at a time. There will be as many arrangements of these 4 letters taken 4 at a time as there are permutations of 4 different things taken 4 at a time. Hence, the number of words starting with $A = 4! = 24$ . Then, starting with G, the number of words $= \\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$ as after placing G at the extreme left position, we are left with the letters A, A, I and N. Similarly, there are 12 words starting with the next letter I. Total number of words so far obtained $= 24 + 12 + 12 = 48$ . \n\nThe $49^{\\text{th}}$ word is NAAIG. The $50^{\\text{th}}$ word is NAAIG. \n\nExample 23 How many numbers greater than 1000000 can be formed by using the digits 1, 2, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4? \n\nSolution Since, 1000000 is a 7-digit number and the number of digits to be used is also 7. Therefore, the numbers to be counted will be 7-digit only. Also, the numbers have to be greater than 1000000, so they can begin either with 1, 2 or 4. \n\nThe number of numbers beginning with $1 = \\frac{6!}{3!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 6}{2} = 60$ , as when 1 is fixed at the extreme left position, the remaining digits to be rearranged will be 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, in which there are 3, 2s and 2, 4s. \n\nTotal numbers beginning with 2 \n\nand total numbers beginning with $4 = \\frac{6!}{3!} = 4 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 120$ \n\nTherefore, the required number of numbers $= 60 + 180 + 120 = 360$ . \n\nAlternative Method \n\nThe number of 7-digit arrangements, clearly, $\\frac{7!}{3!2!} = 420$ . But, this will include those numbers also, which have 0 at the extreme left position. The number of such arrangements $\\frac{6!}{3!2!}$ (by fixing 0 at the extreme left position) = 60. \n\nTherefore, the required number of numbers $= 420 - 60 = 360$ . \n\nNote If one or more than one digits given in the list is repeated, it will be understood that in any number, the digits can be used as many times as is given in the list, e.g., in the above example 1 and 0 can be used only once whereas 2 and 4 can be used 3 times and 2 times, respectively. \n\nExample 24 In how many ways can 5 girls and 3 boys be seated in a row so that no two boys are together? \n\nSolution Let us first seat the 5 girls. This can be done in 5! ways. For each such arrangement, the three boys can be seated only at the cross marked places. \n\nThere are 6 cross marked places and the three boys can be seated in $^6\\mathrm{P}_3$ ways. Hence, by multiplication principle, the total number of ways \n\nMiscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 6 \n\n(i) exactly 3 girls? (ii) atleast 3 girls? (iii) atmost 3 girls? \n\n4. If the different permutations of all the letter of the word EXAMINATION are \n\nlisted as in a dictionary, how many words are there in this list before the first word starting with E? \n\nSummary \n\nare of first kind, $p_2$ objects are of the second kind, ..., $p_k$ objects are of the $k^{\\text{th}}$ kind and rest, if any, are all different is $\\frac{n!}{p_1! p_2! \\cdots p_k!}$ . \n\nThe number of combinations of $n$ different things taken $r$ at a time, denoted by ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ , is given by ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$ , $0 \\leq r \\leq n$ . \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe concepts of permutations and combinations can be traced back to the advent of Jainism in India and perhaps even earlier. The credit, however, goes to the Jains who treated its subject matter as a self-contained topic in mathematics, under the name Vikalpa. \n\nAmong the Jains, Mahavira, (around 850) is perhaps the world's first mathematician credited with providing the general formulae for permutations and combinations. \n\nIn the 6th century B.C., Sushruta, in his medicinal work, Sushruta Samhita, asserts that 63 combinations can be made out of 6 different tastes, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. Pingala, a Sanskrit scholar around third century B.C., gives the method of determining the number of combinations of a given number of letters, taken one at a time, two at a time, etc. in his work Chhanda Sutra. Bhaskaracharya (born 1114) treated the subject matter of permutations and combinations under the name Anka Pasha in his famous work Lilavati. In addition to the general formulae for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ and $^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ already provided by Mahavira, Bhaskaracharya gives several important theorems and results concerning the subject. \n\nOutside India, the subject matter of permutations and combinations had its humble beginnings in China in the famous book I-King (Book of changes). It is difficult to give the approximate time of this work, since in 213 B.C., the emperor had ordered all books and manuscripts in the country to be burnt which fortunately was not completely carried out. Greeks and later Latin writers also did some scattered work on the theory of permutations and combinations. \n\nSome Arabic and Hebrew writers used the concepts of permutations and combinations in studying astronomy. Rabbi ben Ezra, for instance, determined the number of combinations of known planets taken two at a time, three at a time and so on. This was around 1140. It appears that Rabbi ben Ezra did not know \n\nthe formula for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . However, he was aware that $^n\\mathrm{C}_r = ^n\\mathrm{C}_{n - r}$ for specific values $n$ and $r$ . In 1321, Levi Ben Gerson, another Hebrew writer came up with the formulae for $^n\\mathrm{P}_r$ , $^n\\mathrm{P}_n$ and the general formula for $^n\\mathrm{C}_r$ . \n\nThe first book which gives a complete treatment of the subject matter of permutations and combinations is Ars Conjectandi written by a Swiss, Jacob Bernoulli (1654 - 1705), posthumously published in 1713. This book contains essentially the theory of permutations and combinations as is known today.",

    "content": "BINOMIAL THEOREM \n\nMathematics is a most exact science and its conclusions are capable of absolute proofs. - C.P. STEINMETZ \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nIn earlier classes, we have learnt how to find the squares and cubes of binomials like $a + b$ and $a - b$ . Using them, we could evaluate the numerical values of numbers like $(98)^2 = (100 - 2)^2$ , $(999)^3 = (1000 - 1)^3$ , etc. However, for higher powers like $(98)^5$ , $(101)^6$ , etc., the calculations become difficult by using repeated multiplication. This difficulty was overcome by a theorem known as binomial theorem. It gives an easier way to expand $(a + b)^n$ , where $n$ is an integer or a rational number. In this Chapter, we study binomial theorem for positive integral indices only. \n\n7.2 Binomial Theorem for Positive Integral Indices \n\nLet us have a look at the following identities done earlier: \n\nIn these expansions, we observe that \n\nWe now arrange the coefficients in these expansions as follows (Fig 7.1): \n\nDo we observe any pattern in this table that will help us to write the next row? Yes we do. It can be seen that the addition of 1's in the row for index 1 gives rise to 2 in the row for index 2. The addition of 1, 2 and 2, 1 in the row for index 2, gives rise to 3 and 3 in the row for index 3 and so on. Also, 1 is present at the beginning and at the end of each row. This can be continued till any index of our interest. \n\nWe can extend the pattern given in Fig 7.2 by writing a few more rows. \n\nPascal's Triangle \n\nThe structure given in Fig 7.2 looks like a triangle with 1 at the top vertex and running down the two slanting sides. This array of numbers is known as Pascal's triangle, after the name of French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is also known as Meru Prastara by Pingla. \n\nExpansions for the higher powers of a binomial are also possible by using Pascal's triangle. Let us expand $(2x + 3y)^5$ by using Pascal's triangle. The row for index 5 is \n\n1 5 10 10 5 1 \n\nUsing this row and our observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we get \n\nNow, if we want to find the expansion of $(2x + 3y)^{12}$ , we are first required to get the row for index 12. This can be done by writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle till index 12. This is a slightly lengthy process. The process, as you observe, will become more difficult, if we need the expansions involving still larger powers. \n\nWe thus try to find a rule that will help us to find the expansion of the binomial for any power without writing all the rows of the Pascal's triangle, that come before the row of the desired index. \n\nFor this, we make use of the concept of combinations studied earlier to rewrite the numbers in the Pascal's triangle. We know that ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$ , $0 \\leq r \\leq n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer. Also, ${}^n\\mathrm{C}_0 = 1 = {}^n\\mathrm{C}_n$ \n\nThe Pascal's triangle can now be rewritten as (Fig 7.3) \n\nObserving this pattern, we can now write the row of the Pascal's triangle for any index without writing the earlier rows. For example, for the index 7 the row would be \n\nThus, using this row and the observations (i), (ii) and (iii), we have \n\nAn expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index say $n$ can now be visualised using these observations. We are now in a position to write the expansion of a binomial to any positive integral index. \n\n7.2.1 Binomial theorem for any positive integer $n$ , \n\nProof The proof is obtained by applying principle of mathematical induction. \n\nLet the given statement be \n\nFor $n = 1$ , we have \n\nThus, P (1) is true. \n\nSuppose $\\mathrm{P}(k)$ is true for some positive integer $k$ , i.e. \n\n$(a + b)^{k} = {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{0}a^{k} + {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{1}a^{k - 1}b + {}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{2}a^{k - 2}b^{2} + \\ldots +{}^{k}\\mathrm{C}_{k}b^{k}$ 1 \n\nWe shall prove that $\\mathrm{P}(k + 1)$ is also true, i.e., \n\n[by actual multiplication] \n\n(by using ${}^{\\mathrm{k + 1}}\\mathrm{C}_0 = 1$ , ${}^k\\mathrm{C}_r + {}^k\\mathrm{C}_{r - 1} = {}^k +1\\mathrm{C}_r$ and ${}^k\\mathrm{C}_k = 1 = {}^k +1\\mathrm{C}_{k + 1}$ ) \n\nThus, it has been proved that $\\mathrm{P}(k + 1)$ is true whenever $\\mathrm{P}(k)$ is true. Therefore, by principle of mathematical induction, $\\mathrm{P}(n)$ is true for every positive integer $n$ . \n\nWe illustrate this theorem by expanding $(x + 2)^6$ : \n\nThus $(x + 2)^6 = x^6 + 12x^5 + 60x^4 + 160x^3 + 240x^2 + 192x + 64$ . \n\nObservations \n\n1. The notation $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}{}^{n} \\mathrm{C}_{k} a^{n-k} b^{k}$ stands for \n\nHence the theorem can also be stated as \n\n7.2.2 Some special cases In the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ \n\n(i) Taking $a = x$ and $b = -y$ , we obtain \n\nThus $(x - y)^{n} = {}^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{0}x^{n} - {}^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{1}x^{n - 1}y + {}^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{2}x^{n - 2}y^{2} + \\ldots +(-1)^{n}{}^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{n}y^{n}$ \n\nUsing this, we have $(x - 2y)^{5} = {}^{5}\\mathrm{C}_{0}x^{5} - {}^{5}\\mathrm{C}_{1}x^{4}(2y) + {}^{5}\\mathrm{C}_{2}x^{3}(2y)^{2} - {}^{5}\\mathrm{C}_{3}x^{2}(2y)^{3} +$ \n\n(ii) Taking $a = 1$ , $b = x$ , we obtain \n\nThus \n\nIn particular, for $x = 1$ , we have \n\n(iii) Taking $a = 1$ , $b = -x$ , we obtain \n\nIn particular, for $x = 1$ , we get \n\nExample 1 Expand $\\left(x^{2} + \\frac{3}{x}\\right)^{4}, x \\neq 0$ \n\nSolution By using binomial theorem, we have \n\nExample 2 Compute $(98)^{5}$ . \n\nSolution We express 98 as the sum or difference of two numbers whose powers are easier to calculate, and then use Binomial Theorem. \n\nWrite $98 = 100 - 2$ \n\nTherefore, $(98)^{5} = (100 - 2)^{5}$ \n\nExample 3 Which is larger $(1.01)^{1000000}$ or $10,000?$ \n\nSolution Splitting 1.01 and using binomial theorem to write the first few terms we have \n\nHence $(1.01)^{1000000} > 10000$ \n\nExample 4 Using binomial theorem, prove that $6^{n} - 5n$ always leaves remainder 1 when divided by 25. \n\nSolution For two numbers $a$ and $b$ if we can find numbers $q$ and $r$ such that $a = bq + r$ , then we say that $b$ divides $a$ with $q$ as quotient and $r$ as remainder. Thus, in order to show that $6^n - 5n$ leaves remainder 1 when divided by 25, we prove that $6^n - 5n = 25k + 1$ , where $k$ is some natural number. \n\nWe have \n\nFor $a = 5$ , we get \n\ni.e. $(6)^{n} = 1 + 5n + 5^{2}.^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{2} + 5^{3}.^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{3} + \\ldots +5^{n}$ \n\ni.e. $6^{n} - 5n = 1 + 5^{2}$ $(^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{2} + ^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{3}5 + \\ldots +5^{n - 2})$ \n\nor $6^{n} - 5n = 1 + 25\\left(^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{2} + 5.^{n}\\mathrm{C}_{3} + \\ldots +5^{n - 2}\\right)$ \n\nor $6^{n} - 5n = 25k + 1$ where $k = {}^n\\mathbf{C}_2 + 5.^n\\mathbf{C}_3 + \\ldots +5^{n - 2}.$ \n\nThis shows that when divided by 25, $6^{n} - 5n$ leaves remainder 1. \n\nEXERCISE 7.1 \n\nExpand each of the expressions in Exercises 1 to 5. \n\n1. $(1 - 2x)^{5}$ \n\n2. $\\left(\\frac{2}{x} -\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{5}$ \n\n3. $(2x - 3)^6$ \n\n4. $\\left(\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^5$ \n\n5. $\\left(x + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^6$ \n\nUsing binomial theorem, evaluate each of the following: \n\nMiscellaneous Exercise on Chapter 7 \n\nSummary \n\nHistorical Note \n\nThe ancient Indian mathematicians knew about the coefficients in the expansions of $(x + y)^n$ , $0 \\leq n \\leq 7$ .

This triangular arrangement is also found in the work of Chinese mathematician Chu-shi-kie in 1303. The term binomial coefficients was first introduced by the German mathematician, Michael Stipel (1486-1567) in approximately 1544. Bombelli (1572) also gave the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b)^n$ , for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 7$ and Oughtred (1631) gave them for $n = 1, 2, \\ldots, 10$ . The arithmetic triangle, popularly known as Pascal's triangle and similar to the Meru-Prastara of Pingla was constructed by the French mathematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) in 1665. \n\nThe present form of the binomial theorem for integral values of $n$ appeared in Trate du triangle arithmetic, written by Pascal and published posthumously in 1665.",

This series can also be expressed in abbreviated form using the sigma notation, i.e., \n\nIn this Chapter, we shall study about some special types of series which may be required in different problem situations. \n\nA.1.2 Binomial Theorem for any Index \n\nIn Chapter 8, we discussed the Binomial Theorem in which the index was a positive integer. In this Section, we state a more general form of the theorem in which the index is not necessarily a whole number. It gives us a particular type of infinite series, called Binomial Series. We illustrate few applications, by examples. \n\nWe know the formula \n\nHere, $n$ is non-negative integer. Observe that if we replace index $n$ by negative integer or a fraction, then the combinations ${}^n\\mathbf{C}_r$ do not make any sense. \n\nWe now state (without proof), the Binomial Theorem, giving an infinite series in which the index is negative or a fraction and not a whole number. \n\nTheorem The formula \n\nholds whenever $|x| < 1$ . \n\nRemark 1. Note carefully the condition $|x| < 1$ , i.e., $-1 < x < 1$ is necessary when $m$ is negative integer or a fraction. For example, if we take $x = -2$ and $m = -2$ , we obtain \n\nor $1 = 1 + 4 + 12 + \\dots .$ \n\nThis is not possible. \n\n2.

Particularly, if we take $a_1 = a$ , then the resulting sequence $a, ar, ar^2, \\ldots, ar^{n-1}$ is taken as the standard form of G.P., where $a$ is first term and $r$ , the common ratio of G.P. \n\nEarlier, we have discussed the formula to find the sum of finite series $a + ar + ar^2 + \\ldots + ar^{n-1}$ which is given by \n\nIn this section, we state the formula to find the sum of infinite geometric series $a + ar + ar^2 + \\ldots + ar^{q-1} + \\ldots$ and illustrate the same by examples. \n\nLet us consider the G.P. 1, $\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{4}{9}, \\ldots$ \n\nHere $a = 1, r = \\frac{2}{3}$ . We have \n\nLet us study the behaviour of $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n$ as $n$ becomes larger and larger. \n\nWe observe that as $n$ becomes larger and larger, $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n$ becomes closer and closer to zero. Mathematically, we say that as $n$ becomes sufficiently large, $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n$ becomes sufficiently small. In other words, as $n \\to \\infty, \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^n \\to 0$ . Consequently, we find that the sum of infinitely many terms is given by $S = 3$ . \n\nThus, for infinite geometric progression $a, ar, ar^2, \\ldots$ , if numerical value of common ratio $r$ is less than 1, then \n\nIn this case, $r^n \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$ since $|r| < 1$ and then $\\frac{ar^n}{1 - r} \\to 0$ . Therefore, \n\nSymbolically, sum to infinity of infinite geometric series is denoted by S. Thus, we have $S = \\frac{a}{1 - r}$ . \n\nFor example \n\nExample 2 Find the sum to infinity of the G.P. ; \n\nSolution Here $a = \\frac{-5}{4}$ and $r = -\\frac{1}{4}$ . Also $|r| < 1$ . \n\nHence, the sum to infinity is $\\frac{\\frac{-5}{4}}{1 + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{-5}{4}}{\\frac{5}{4}} = -1$ . \n\nA.1.4 Exponential Series \n\nLeonhard Euler (1707 - 1783), the great Swiss mathematician introduced the number $e$ in his calculus text in 1748. The number $e$ is useful in calculus as $\\pi$ in the study of the circle. \n\nConsider the following infinite series of numbers \n\nThe sum of the series given in (1) is denoted by the number $e$ \n\nLet us estimate the value of the number $e$ . \n\nSince every term of the series (1) is positive, it is clear that its sum is also positive. \n\nConsider the two sums \n\nand $\\frac{1}{2^2} +\\frac{1}{2^3} +\\frac{1}{2^4} +\\dots +\\frac{1}{2^{n - 1}} +\\dots$ ... (3) \n\nObserve that \n\nTherefore, by analogy, we can say that \n\nWe observe that each term in (2) is less than the corresponding term in (3), \n\nAdding $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1!} + \\frac{1}{2!}\\right)$ on both sides of (4), we get, \n\nLeft hand side of (5) represents the series (1). Therefore $e < 3$ and also $e > 2$ and hence $2 < e < 3$ . \n\nRemark The exponential series involving variable $x$ can be expressed as \n\nExample 3 Find the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of $e^{2x + 3}$ as a series in powers of $x$ . \n\nSolution In the exponential series \n\nreplacing $x$ by $(2x + 3)$ , we get \n\nHere, the general term is $\\frac{(2x + 3)^n}{n!} = \\frac{(3 + 2x)^n}{n!}$ . This can be expanded by the Binomial Theorem as \n\nHere, the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is $\\frac{{}^{n} \\mathrm{C}_{2} 3^{n-2} 2^{2}}{n!}$ . Therefore, the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the whole series is \n\nThus $2e^{3}$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the expansion of $e^{2x + 3}$ . Alternatively $e^{2x + 3} = e^{3}$ . $e^{2x}$ \n\nThus, the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion of $e^{2x + 3}$ is $e^3 \\cdot \\frac{2^2}{2!} = 2e^3$ . \n\nExample 4 Find the value of $e^2$ , rounded off to one decimal place. \n\nSolution Using the formula of exponential series involving $x$ , we have \n\nPutting $x = 2$ , we get \n\nOn the other hand, we have \n\nThus, $e^2$ lies between 7.355 and 7.4. Therefore, the value of $e^2$ , rounded off to one decimal place, is 7.4. \n\nA.1.5 Logarithmic Series \n\nAnother very important series is logarithmic series which is also in the form of infinite series. We state the following result without proof and illustrate its application with an example. \n\nTheorem If $|x| < 1$ , then \n\nThe series on the right hand side of the above is called the logarithmic series. \n\nNote The expansion of $\\log_e(1 + x)$ is valid for $x = 1$ . Substituting $x = 1$ in the expansion of $\\log_e(1 + x)$ , we get \n\nExample 5 If $\\alpha, \\beta$ are the roots of the equation $x^{2} - px + q = 0$ , prove that \n\nSolution Right hand side = [αx - α²x²/2 + α³x³/3 - ... ] + [βx - β²x²/2 + β³x³/3 - ... ] \n\nHere, we have used the facts $\\alpha + \\beta = p$ and $\\alpha \\beta = q$ . We know this from the given roots of the quadratic equation. We have also assumed that both $|\\alpha x| < 1$ and $|\\beta x| < 1$ .",
